The bill has put in place procedures and measures to ensure the protection of personal data.&nbsp;
Every controller must ensure integrity and confidentiality of the personal data that is being processed by using appropriate technical and organisational measures including encryption, pseudonymisation, anonymisation or access controls or such other measures as may be prescribed so as to prevent unauthorised or unlawful processing of personal data or loss, destruction or damage of personal data.  
In addition, every controller has a duty to implement internal controls and procedures by way of a “Data Protection Management Programme” that:&nbsp;

establishes and maintains duly catalogued records to demonstrate the manner in which the implementation of the data protection obligations stipulated in the bill are being carried out by the controller
is designed on the basis of structure, scale, volume and sensitivity of the processing activities of the controller
provides for appropriate safeguards based on data protection impact assessments (elaborated on hereinbelow)
is integrated into the governance structure of the controller.&nbsp;

A “personal data protection impact assessment” will have to be carried out by a controller where processing involves:&nbsp;

systematic and extensive evaluation of personal data or special categories of data, including profiling
systematic monitoring of publicly accessible areas or telecommunication networks
a processing activity, taking into consideration the scope and risks associated with the processing &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

A fresh personal data protection impact assessment must be conducted by the controller whenever there is any change in the methodology, technology or process adopted in processing the personal data.&nbsp;
Where a personal data protection impact assessment indicates that the processing of certain personal data could result in a risk of harm to the rights of the data subjects, the controller must take necessary measure to mitigate the risk, prior to the processing of the personal data. If, after taking measures to mitigate the risk, the controller is still unable to do so, a consultation with the Authority will be required prior to the processing of such data.Last modified 21 Dec 2021
