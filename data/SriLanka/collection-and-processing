Every controller must ensure that personal data is being processed for a “specific, explicit and legitimate purpose”, and that the personal data collected is not further processed in a manner which is incompatible with that purpose.&nbsp;
The controller must confine processing to the defined purpose, by ensuring that personal data processed is “adequate, relevant and proportionate” to the extent necessary to achieve the purpose for which the data was collected or processed.&nbsp;
The following information must be provided at the time the data is being collected from the data subject:&nbsp;

identity and contact details of the controller
contact details of the data protection officer
the purpose for which the data will be processed and the legal basis for processing
the legitimate interest pursued by the controller or the third party
the categories of personal data being collected
recipients or third parties with whom their data will be shared
information on cross-border transfers
the time period for retention of the data
the rights of data subjects, such as the right to withdraw consent and the procedure to enforce these rights
the ability to file a complaint with the Authority
whether the provision of personal data is a statutory or contractual obligation or requirement and the consequences of failing to provide such data
the existence of automated individual decision-making, including profiling, information about the logic involved and potential consequences of processing for the data subject.&nbsp;

When a controller intends to further process personal data for a purpose other than for which it was originally collected, the controller must provide the data subject with detailed information on the further processing and the purpose for it.&nbsp;
When personal data has been obtained through means other than through a direct interaction with the data subject, the controller must provide the data subject with the source from which the personal data originates, and whether or not it came from a publicly accessible source where applicable, in addition to the information that would be required to be provided to a data subject had there been a direct interaction.&nbsp;
This controller must provide the requisite information to the data subject:&nbsp;

within a reasonable period of time after obtaining the personal data, but at least within one month, having regard to the specific circumstances in which the personal data is processed;
if the personal data is to be used for communication with the data subject, at least at the time of the first communication with the data subject; or
if a disclosure to another receipt is envisaged, at least when the personal data is first disclosed.&nbsp;

Personal data may be lawfully processed under any one of the following grounds:

with the consent of the data subject to process his personal data
where the processing of personal data is necessary for the performance of a contract which the data subject is a party to, or take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract
where the processing of personal data is necessary to comply with a legal obligation to which the controller or the processor is subject to
where processing of personal data is necessary to respond to an emergency that threatens the life, health or safety of the data subject or another natural person
Where processing of personal data is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercises of authority conferred on the controller or processor
where processing of personal data is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, except where this interest is overridden by the interests of the data subject (in particular when the data subject is a child). To this end, a “legitimate interest” would include:

where the data subject is a client or in the service of the controller
where a data subject reasonably expects at the time, given the context of the collection of the personal data, that processing for that purpose may take place
where processing of personal data is strictly necessary for the purpose of preventing fraud
processing of personal data to the extent strictly necessary and proportionate for the purpose of ensuring network and information security.&nbsp;



Special categories of personal data
Special categories of personal data may be lawfully processed under any one of the following grounds:&nbsp;

The data subject has given consent to the processing of special categories of personal data, unless processing of such personal data is prohibited by another written law, in which case, the data subject’s consent is not a consideration. If the data subject is a child, consent must be obtained from the parent or legal guardian of the child.
Processing is necessary for the purpose of carrying out the obligations of the controller and exercising of the rights of the data subject, in the field of employment, social security and for public health purposes (including ensuring public safety, preventing and controlling communicable diseases and other serious threats to public health).
Processing is necessary to respond to an emergency that threatens, the life, health and safety of the data subject or another natural person where the data subject is physically or legally incapable of giving consent.
Processing relates to personal data which is manifestly made public by the data subject.
Processing is required for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims or whenever courts are acting in their judicial capacity.
Processing is necessary for a purpose mandated by written law, which should be “necessary and proportionate” to the aim pursued, while providing suitable and specific measures to safeguard the rights and freedoms of the data subject.
Where necessary for preventative or occupational medicine, medical diagnosis, the provision of care or treatment and the management of health care services. In this instance the data should be processed by a health professional licensed under and authorised by Sri Lankan law.
Processing is necessary for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes in accordance with the law, provided suitable and specific measures are taken to safeguard the rights and freedoms of the data subjects.

A controller has the following obligations:&nbsp;

Ensuring that personal data that is processed is accurate and kept up to date, with every reasonable step being taken to erase or rectify any inaccurate or outdated personal data, without overdue delay.
Ensuring that personal data is kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects only for such period which is necessary or required to achieve the purpose for which the data was processed. A controller may store personal data for longer periods if the personal data is being processed further for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific research, historical research or statistical purposes.
Ensuring integrity and confidentiality by using measures such as encryption, pseudonymisation, anonymisation or access controls in order to prevent the unauthorised or unlawful processing of personal data or loss, destruction or damage of personal data.
Processing personal data in a transparent manner, by providing data subjects with information relating to the collection of data and information regarding any decisions made in relation to requests made by data subjects, in writing or by electronic means and “in a concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form”.
Ensuring that the processor (who is carrying out processing on behalf of the controller) is bound by a contract setting out the parameters of such processing, and is using appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect the rights of the data subjects.&nbsp;

Two or more controllers may jointly determine the purposes and means of processing. Such controllers will be referred to as “joint controllers” who will be jointly responsible to honour these obligations.&nbsp;
Rights of Data Subjects&nbsp;
The proposed legislation has highlighted the rights of data subjects to a significant extent. A controller must respond to any written request made by a data subject, pertaining to his rights, within twenty-one working days of receiving the request. &nbsp;&nbsp;
The right to access personal data
Every data subject has the right, to access their personal data and be provided with confirmation as to whether such personal data has been processed, by submitting a written request.&nbsp;
Right to withdraw consent and object to processing
Every data subject has the right to withdraw consent at any time and the right to request a controller to refrain from further processing of the data subject’s personal data, provided the processing was based on the data subject’s consent.&nbsp;
Right to rectification or completion
Every data subject has the right to request a controller to rectify or complete any personal data that is inaccurate or incomplete.&nbsp;
Right to erasure
The data subject may, under a limited set of circumstances, request the controller to erase his personal data. This includes when a controller is in contravention of his obligations and when the erasure is mandated by a written law or order of a competent court.&nbsp;
The right to appeal
A data subject has the right to appeal to the Data Protection Authority when a controller:&nbsp;

fails to refrain from further processing of the data subject’s personal data
refuses to rectify or complete personal data
refuses to erase personal data
refuses a data subject’s request based on reasons such as national security interests or public order
refuses the request to review a decision made by the controller which is based solely on automated processing.&nbsp;

Automated individual decision making
Every data subject has the right to request a controller to review a decision made by the controller which is based solely on automated processing, which has or has the potential to create an “irreversible and continuous impact on the rights and freedoms of the data subjects under any written law”.&nbsp;
However, this is not an absolute right and will not be enforceable if the controller’s decision, based on automated processing, is:&nbsp;

authorized by a written law
authorised in a manner determined by the Authority
based on the consent of the data subject
necessary for entering into or the performance of a contract between the data subject and the controller (this will not apply to special categories of personal data).&nbsp;

Processing of personal information for criminal investigations&nbsp;
Processing of personal data relating to lawful investigations of offences or related to security measures is lawful, contingent on being in line with applicable written laws and providing appropriate safeguards for the rights and freedoms of data subjects.Last modified 21 Dec 2021
