The Authority may conduct an inquiry on receipt of a complaint or where the Authority has reason to believe that a controller or processor has acted in contravention of the legislation or has failed to comply with the provision of the bill.
Upon having an inquiry, the Authority may issue a directive requiring the controller or processor to either rectify the situation or to cease and refrain from the conduct in question.&nbsp;
A controller or processor who fails to comply with the directive may be subject to a penalty, which may not exceed rupees ten million (Rs. 10,000,000) for each non-compliance.&nbsp;
In addition, if after being subject to a penalty on a previous occasion, a controller or processor fails to conform to a directive, an additional penalty may be levied.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;
A controller or processor may appeal to the Court of Appeal within twenty-one working days, from the date of notification of the penalty, where the burden of proof will be with the controller or processor, to prove compliance with the legislation.&nbsp;
When imposing a penalty, the Authority would have to take the following into consideration:&nbsp;

the nature, gravity, and the duration of the contravention and the nature, scope and purpose of the processing in question, along with the number of data subjects affected and the level of damage suffered by them
any action taken by the controller or processor to mitigate the damage suffered by the data subjects
the effectiveness of the controller’s “data protection management programme”
the degree of cooperation with the Authority, in order to remedy the contravention and mitigate the adverse effects caused by the contravention
the categories of personal data affected by the contravention
the manner by which the Authority came to know of the contravention, in particular if the controller or processor notified the Authority of the contravention
any previous non-compliance by the controller or processor
any other aggravating or mitigating factors including any financial benefits gained or losses avoided as a result, either directly or indirectly, of the contravention.
