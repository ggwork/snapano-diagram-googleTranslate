At present, Sri Lanka does not have legislation in place that exclusively addresses data protection. However, there are existing legislation, such as the Banking Act No. 30 of 1988 (as amended) which provide for the protection of data on a sectoral specific basis.&nbsp;
Sri Lanka is however currently in the process of enacting legislation for the purpose of protecting personal data. The Ministry of Digital Infrastructure and Information Technology of Sri Lanka initially introduced the first draft for the Personal Data Protection Bill (hereinafter referred to as the “bill”) in 2019.&nbsp;
On the 15th of November 2021, the bill was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers of Sri Lanka and subsequently published in the Government Gazette on the 19th of November 2021.&nbsp;
It is currently awaiting approval by the Parliament of Sri Lanka. No exact time frame has been announced as to when this will take place.&nbsp;
The bill is concerned with regulating the processing of personal data, with processing being given a wide definition to include “any operation performed on personal data” which includes but is not limited to the “collection, storage, preservation, alteration, retrieval, disclosure, transmission, making available, erasure, destruction of, consultation, alignment, combination or the carrying out of logical or arithmetical operations on personal data”. &nbsp;&nbsp;
The types of processing that falls under the ambit of the bill are:&nbsp;

the processing of personal data which takes place wholly or partly within Sri Lanka; or
the processing of personal data which is carried out by a controller or processor who:

is domiciled or ordinarily resident in Sri Lanka
is incorporated or established under any written laws of Sri Lanka
is subject to any written law of Sri Lanka
offers goods or services to data subjects in Sri Lanka including the offering of goods or services to specific targeting of data subjects in Sri Lanka
specifically monitors the behaviour of data subjects in Sri Lanka, including profiling with the intention of making decisions in relation to the behaviour of such data subjects insofar as such behaviour takes place in Sri Lanka.&nbsp;



The provisions of the bill will not extend to data which falls outside the confines of personal data, and personal data which is processed purely for private, domestic or household purposes by an individual.Last modified 21 Dec 2021
