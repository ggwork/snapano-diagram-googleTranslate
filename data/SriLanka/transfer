When a public authority processes personal data as a controller or processor, personal data may only be processed in Sri Lanka, and shall not be processed in a third country unless the Authority in consultation with the controller or processor and the relevant regulatory or statutory body, classifies the categories of personal data which may be permitted to be processed in a third country, prescribed by the Minister pursuant to an adequacy decision.
In making an “adequacy decision” the relevant written law and enforcement mechanisms in the specific country relating to the protection of personal data is taken into consideration, along with the processing criteria in that country and such other prescribed criteria relating to the processing of personal data in a third country.&nbsp;
Any such “adequacy decision” made by the Minister will be subject to periodic monitoring of any developments in the third country that may affect the decision, and the decision may be reviewed by the Minister at least every two years. Such adequacy decision will remain in force until amended or revoked by the Minister in consultation with the Authority.
A controller or processor, who is not a public authority, may process personal data:&nbsp;

in a third country pursuant to an adequacy decision; or
in a country, which is not a “third country prescribed pursuant to an adequacy decision”, only when the controller or processor can ensure compliance with the obligations imposed under the bill.&nbsp;

In doing so, in order to ensure compliance, a controller or processor must adopt an instrument, which may be specified by the Authority, to ensure binding and enforceable commitments of the recipient in the third country to ensure the rights of the data subjects are protected and the remedies offered by the legislation are followed.Last modified 21 Dec 2021
