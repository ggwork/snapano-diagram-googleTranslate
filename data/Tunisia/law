Law n° 2004-63 dated July 27, 2004, on the Protection of Personal Data, regulates personal data, but even before that, Tunisia was already a pioneer in its region since 2002 in the field of personal data protection. This law was endorsed by the 2014 constitutional embodiment of the protection of privacy, which has placed this protection at the forefront of the rights and freedoms to be guaranteed in the new Republic.
Additionally, articles 56, 61 and 75 of the Organic Law n° 2015-26 of August 7, 2015 on the Fight Against Terrorism and the Prohibition of Money Laundering addresses the subject of personal data and when the use of personal data is permitted.
Tunisia became the 51st Member State of the Council of Europe Convention 108 on November 1, 2017.
In March 2018, it introduced a new draft law on the protection of personal data in line with the new European GDPR in Parliament.Last modified 20 Dec 2021
