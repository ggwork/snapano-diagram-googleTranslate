Kuwait does not have a specific personal data protection law. &nbsp;However recently the Communications and Telecommunications Regulatory Authority (CITRA) issued Decision No. 42 of 2021 on Data Privacy Protection Regulation (“Regulation”) imposing obligations in relation to data protection on Telecommunication Services Providers and related industry sectors.
The Regulation sets out detailed guidelines for the collection, storage, process and transfer of data by private sector and public sector service providers. The most interesting part of the Regulation is the wider ambit of the definition of ‘Service Provider’, which ranges from traditional telecommunications service providers to anyone who operates a website, smart application or cloud computing service, collects or processes personal data or directs another party to do so on its behalf through information centres owned or used by them directly or indirectly.&nbsp;
&nbsp;Exclusions to the obligations under the Regulation are for the collection and processing of private personal or family data by an individual; or for security agencies for the purposes of controlling crimes and implementing state security measures.&nbsp;
This is in addition to the obligations under&nbsp;Law No. 20 of 2014 (the E-Commerce Law) which requires that client data relating to positional affairs, personal status, health status, certain financial information and other personal information must be retained privately and confidentially by the recipient and its employees. Such data may not be disclosed without client consent or a court order.Last modified 21 Feb 2022
