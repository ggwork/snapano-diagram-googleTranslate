The Data Protection (Bailiwick of Guernsey) Law, 2017 ("DPL 2017") came into force on 25 May 2018 to coincide with the enforcement of the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/670 ("GDPR").&nbsp;
Adequacy
The DPL 2017 replaced Guernsey's first set of data protection legislation that was introduced in 2001 in the form of the Data Protection (Bailiwick of Guernsey) Law, 2001, as amended ("DPL 2001"). The DPL 2001 had been implemented in response to the EU Directive 95/46/EC. Whereas the DPL 2001 was modelled on a UK enactment, the DPL 2017 is stated to be 'equivalent' to the GDPR.
In 2003 Guernsey was recognised by the European Commission as providing an adequate level of protection for the free flow of personal data to the Bailiwick (see Opinion 02072/07/EN WP 141 and Opinion 10595/03/EN WP 79). Following the enforcement of the GDPR from 25 May 2018, the adequacy decision remains valid and effective in respect of Guernsey's revised data protection regime under the DPL 2017. The adequacy decision is currently being reassessed by the European Commission (as per Article 45(9) GDPR)&nbsp;and confirmation of the outcome of such reassessment is&nbsp;expected during 2021.
Scope and applicability
The DPL 2017 applies in relation to the processing of personal data where:

the processing is by automated means (whether wholly or partly) OR if, the processing is not by automated means, it is intended to form part of a filing system; and
the processing is conducted by a controller or processor established in the Bailiwick of Guernsey ("Bailiwick") OR the personal data is that of a Bailiwick resident and is processed in the context of the offering good or services (whether or not for payment) to the resident or the monitoring of the resident's behaviour in the Bailiwick. The term "established in the Bailiwick" is defined under the DPL 2017.

In practice, this means that there may be instances where controllers and processors established in the Bailiwick are subject to both the DPL 2017 and, where they process personal data of data subjects who are in the EU, the GDPR.
A domestic exception is available where the processing is for the purpose of an individual's personal, family or household affairs.
As from 25 May 2019, the initial period of transitional relief granted to controllers and processors in Guernsey came to an end.&nbsp; All controllers and processors must therefore comply with all aspects of the DPL 2017 (including the duty to notify pre-collected data, carry out privacy impact assessments, comply with statutory obligations in relation to processor and joint controller-led duties and renew consents collected prior to 25 May 2018).&nbsp;
There is also a requirement (in certain instances) for controllers&nbsp;not 'established in the&nbsp;Bailiwick'&nbsp;to designate and authorise a representative in the Bailiwick.Last modified 5 Jan 2021
