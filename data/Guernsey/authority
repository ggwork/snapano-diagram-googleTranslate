Overall oversight of the implementation of the DPL 2017 is vested in the Data Protection Authority ("Authority"). The Authority delegates many of the day-to-day regulatory functions and provides governance to an independent operational body known as the Office of the Data Protection Authority ("ODPA") (formerly, the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner).
The Authority and the ODPA are also required, pursuant to The Data Protection (International Cooperation and Assistance) (Bailiwick of Guernsey) Regulations, 2018 to have regard to Articles 60 – 62 GDPR by providing mutual cooperation with other supervisory authorities relating to both the GDPR and the DPL 2017.
