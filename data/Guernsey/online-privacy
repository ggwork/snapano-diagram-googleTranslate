The 2011 amendments to the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003 by the UK in relation to cookies did not find their way into Guernsey law and there are no immediate plans for this to be done.&nbsp; However, certain aspects of online privacy nevertheless remain governed by the e-Privacy Ordinance (defined under Electronic Marketing above).
As a matter of good practice:

the use of cookies should be identified to web users
cookies should be accompanied with a description of what the cookies are doing and why they are being used
consent should be obtained (at least initially) from the web user where the website intends to store a cookie on their device.

Consent in this context must be freely given, specific, informed and an unambiguous positive action (although it does not need to be explicit).
Traffic data held by a service provider must be erased or anonymised when it is no longer necessary for the purpose of a transmission or communication and only used for permitted purposes.&nbsp; It must also be accompanied by information as to the nature of the processing.&nbsp; Exceptions include if the information is being retained in order to provide a value added service to the data subject or if it is held with their consent.
Traffic data should only be processed by a service provider for (a) the management of billing or traffic, (b) customer enquiries, (c) the prevention or detection of fraud, (d) the marketing of electronic communications services, or (e) the provision of a value added service.
Location data may only be processed in circumstances where the organisation processing such data is a public communications provider, a provider of a value added service, or a person acting on the authority of such provider and only where the user / subscriber cannot be identified from that data (i.e. because they are anonymous) or for the provision of a value added service with consent.
Given the fundamental changes to the data protection regime since the e-Privacy Ordinance was introduced in 2004 and the ongoing negotiations in Europe in relation to the so-called 'e-Privacy Regulation' ("Regulation"), further amendments to the e-Privacy Ordinance are, perhaps, inevitable.&nbsp; The States of Guernsey continues to monitor the progress of the draft Regulation in the meantime.Last modified 5 Jan 2021
