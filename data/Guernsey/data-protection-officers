A data protection officer ("DPO") must be appointed where:

processing is carried out by a public authority (other than a court, or tribunal acting in a judicial capacity); or
the core processing operations of the controller or processor require or involve "large-scale and systematic monitoring of data subjects" or "large-scale processing of special category of data".

The ODPA has issued guidance clarifying what is intended by the use of the term "large-scale processing", noting that this term is not defined in either the GDPR or the DPL 2017.
The ODPA's guidance references the guidance on the appointment of DPOs ("DPO Guidelines") issued by the EU's former advisory body (previously known as the Article 29 Working Party and now replaced by the European Data Protection Board ("EDPB")). The ODPA advises controllers and processors to take into account the terms of both the GDPR and the DPO Guidelines when assessing whether or not a DPO is required to be appointed. It also clarifies that small businesses in Guernsey are, as a general rule, unlikely to be undertaking large-scale processing unless they work with large databases of customers or other types of data subjects. Finally, the ODPA expects controllers and processors to review the scope and nature of processing periodically to ascertain whether or not their prior assessment remains valid or if there are sufficient factors to warrant appointing a DPO. All controllers and processors should document their decision-making and the outcome of such reviews.Last modified 5 Jan 2021
