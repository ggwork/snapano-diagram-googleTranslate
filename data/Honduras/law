Personal data protection is regulated mainly in:
National Constitution: Article 182 provides the constitutional protection of habeas data, giving individuals the right 'to access any file or record, private or public, electronic or hand written, that contains information which may produce damage to personal honour and family privacy. It is also a method to prevent the transmission or disclosure of such data, rectify inaccurate or misleading data, update data, require confidentiality and to eliminate false information. This guarantee does not affect the secrecy of journalistic sources.'
Law of the Civil Registry (Article 109, Decree 62-2004). This law refers only to public personal information that is contained in the archives of the Civil Registry.
Law for Transparency and for Access to Public Information (Article 3.5, Decree 170-2006). This law enables the access of any person to all the information contained in public entities, except that which is classified as 'Confidential.' It also extends the constitutional protection of habeas data and forbids the transmission of personal information that may cause any kind of discrimination or any moral or economic damage to people.
Rulings on the Law for Transparency and for Access to Public Information (Article 42, Accord 001-2008). Provide a definition of databases containing personal confidential information, and requires data subject consent, prior to the use of it by any third party.
In addition, the Law for the Protection of Confidential Personal Data (the “Law”) is currently in discussion in the Honduran Congress. Congress has approved the first chapters of the Law. The complete approval of the Law and the date for when the Law will enter into force is expected in the first half of 2019.Last modified 24 Jan 2022
