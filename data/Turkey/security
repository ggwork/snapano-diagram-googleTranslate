In light of the provisions of the LPPD and consistent with the principles of good faith, those entrusted with personal data are expected to ensure protection of such data. Under the LPPD, the data controller is required to ensure that appropriate technical and organizational measures are taken to prevent all illegal processing and to ensure the data is not destroyed, lost, amended, disclosed or transferred without authority. Such measures must ensure an appropriate level of security, taking into account the state of the art and the costs of their implementation in relation to the risks inherent in the processing and the nature of the data to be protected. Additionally, the data controller has to carry out the necessary inspections on its own institution or organization in order to ensure the implementation of the LPPD.
Data controllers and data processors shall not disclose any personal data in contradiction with the provisions of LPPD and shall not use any personal data for any purposes except for the purpose of processing. This obligation continues after leaving their institution.
In addition, the LPPD enables data subjects to apply to data controllers by various means in relation to their rights stated in Article 11. Data controllers have an obligation to take every necessary administrative and technical measure effectively to finalize these applications in accordance with the LPPD and in good faith. The Communiqu√© on Procedures and Principles for Application to Data Controller dated March 10, 2018, numbered 30356 outlines the procedures of application.Last modified 13 Jan 2022
