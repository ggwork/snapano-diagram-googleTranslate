The LPPD distinguishes between the transfer of personal data to third parties in Turkey and the transfer of personal data to third countries.
Transfer of personal data to third parties
In principle, personal data can be transferred to third parties with the explicit consent of the data subject. The conditions and exemptions applied to collection and processing of personal data also apply to the transfer of personal data to third parties.
Transfer of personal data to parties in third countries
In addition to the conditions and exemptions applied to the transfer of personal data to third parties, one of the following conditions shall exist for transfer of data to parties in third countries:

The country to which personal data will be sent shall have sufficient level of protection;
The data controllers in Turkey and in the target country shall undertake protection in writing and obtain the Personal Data Protection Board's permission; and
Data controller shall sign BCRs published by the Personal Data Protection Board and obtain the approval of the Personal Data Protection Board.

The Personal Data Protection Board shall declare the countries having adequate level of protection. So far, the Personal Data Protection Board has not announced any country as adequate. However, the Personal Data Protection Board has announced the minimum clauses to be found in the undertakings of data controllers by setting out examples of undertaking where there is not an adequate level of protection in the country where personal data is transferred.Last modified 13 Jan 2022
