Location data
As location data are personal data, the processing of these data must comply with the general rules stipulated by the GDPR, the Data Protection Act and, depending on the context, article 129 of the Belgian Electronic Communication Act. Neither the Data Protection Act nor the DPA Act include specific provisions on location data.&nbsp;
In addition, article 123 of the Belgian Electronic Communication Act stipulates that mobile network operators may process location data of a subscriber or an end user only to the extent&nbsp;that&nbsp;the location data has been anonymised, or if the processing is carried out in the framework of the provision of a service regarding traffic or location data.
The processing of location data in the framework of a service regarding traffic or location data is subject to strict conditions set forth in article 123.
Traffic data
As traffic data constitute personal data, the processing of traffic data must comply with the general rules stipulated by the GDPR, the Data Protection Act and, depending on the context, article 129 of the Belgian Electronic Communication Act. Neither the Data Protection Act nor the DPA Act include specific provisions on traffic data.&nbsp;
However, in accordance with article 122 of the Belgian Electronic Communication Act, mobile network operators are required to delete or anonymise traffic data of their users and subscribers as soon as such data is no longer necessary for the transmission of the communication (subject to compliance with cooperation obligations with certain authorities).&nbsp;
Subject to compliance with specific information obligations and subject to specific restrictions, operators may process certain&nbsp;traffic data for the purposes of:&nbsp;

invoicing and interconnection payments
marketing of the operator’s own electronic communication services or services with traffic or location data (subject to the subscriber’s or end user’s prior consent), and
fraud detection
