There are no general laws in the UAE law covering electronic marketing, however the TDRA has issued a regulation governing telecommunications licensees' electronic communications with subscribers, as well as how they should monitor spam passing through their networks. Articles 21 and 22 of the Cyber Crime Law and Article 20.5 of the TDRA's Consumer Protection Regulation v1.5, as described in the ‘Collection and Processing’ section above, are also worded widely enough to potentially apply to electronic marketing. Article 22 of the Cyber Crime Law, for example, prohibits the use of various electronic devices in order to disclose, without permission, confidential information that has been obtained through the course of a person’s duties.
The TDRA's Unsolicited Electronic Communications Regulation states that telecommunications licensees are under a general obligation to put all practical measures in place to minimise the transmission of Spam having a UAE Link across their Telecommunications Networks, and where they are aware of Spam having a UAE Link sent to or from a particular Electronic Address, they must take all practical means to end the transmission of that Spam and to prevent the future transmission of such Spam. Spam is defined as Marketing Electronic Communications sent to a Recipient without obtaining the Recipient's Consent. Although the Unsolicited Electronic Communications Regulation is targeted and enforced against telecommunications licensees, it effectively puts an obligation upon the licensees to minimise and prevent Spam from being transmitted&nbsp; through their networks.Last modified 17 Jan 2022
