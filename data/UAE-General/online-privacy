There PDPL does not expressly cover online privacy, however the PDPL will apply to Processing online.&nbsp;
Although the UAE Criminal Law does not contain provisions directly relating to the internet, its provisions related to privacy are broadly drafted and therefore could apply to online matters (such as Article 432 as described above).&nbsp;
Additionally, as described in Collection and Processing, under certain circumstances, online privacy is protected through Articles 21 and 22 of the Cyber Crime Law and the TDRA's Consumer Protection Regulation. Unlawful access via the internet, by electronic devices, of financial information (eg Credit Cards and Bank Accounts) without permission is also an offence under the Cyber Crime Law (Articles 12 and 13).Last modified 17 Jan 2022
