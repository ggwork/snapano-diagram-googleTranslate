The DC and DP are required to ensure security of the personal data in their possession by adopting appropriate, reasonable technical measures to prevent loss, damage or destruction of personal data which include the following (article 47):&nbsp;

identify foreseeable risks to personal data under that personâ€™s possession or control, establish and maintain appropriate safeguards against those risks;
regularly verify whether the personal data safeguards are effectively implemented;
ensure that the personal data security safeguards are continually updated in response to new risks or any identified deficiencies.&nbsp;

The NCSA is entitled by the Data Protection Law to conduct inspection and assessment of these security measures.&nbsp;
The Data Protection Law also provides for safeguards that DC or DP processing sensitive personal data must adopt including storing sensitive personal data separately from other types of data or applying measures such as tokenisation, pseudonymisation or encryption (article 11).Last modified 14 Dec 2021
