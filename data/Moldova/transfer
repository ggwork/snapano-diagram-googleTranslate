Transfers of personal data by a controller or a processor are permitted taking into account the principle of free movement of data to EU countries and to third countries that ensures an adequate level of protection of personal data subjects’ rights and of data intended for transfer.&nbsp;
The NCPDP is in charge of maintaining the list of the countries that ensures an adequate level of protection of personal data subject’s rights.&nbsp;
The Law on Personal Data Protection also includes a list of context specific derogations, permitting transfers to countries that do not ensure an adequate level of protection:

if the transfer is provided under an international treaty to which Moldova is a signatory;
the data subject consents to the transfer;
if the transfer is necessary for the conclusion or performance of an agreement or contract concluded between the personal data subject and the controller or between the controller and a third party in the interest of the personal data subject;
if the transfer is necessary in order to protect the life, physical integrity or health of the personal data subject;
if the transfer is carried out solely for journalistic, artistic, scientific and archive purposes of public interest;
if the transfer is made to other companies from the same group as the data controller, provided that the mandatory corporate rules are observed;
the transfer is necessary for the accomplishment of an important public interest, such as national defence, public order or national security, carrying out in good order a criminal trial or ascertaining, exercising or defending a right in court, on the condition that the personal data is processed solely in relation to this purpose and only for longer period is necessary to achieve it;
if the processing takes place under the contract standard for cross-border data transmission, elaborated and approved by the NCPDCP, concluded by the data controller.&nbsp;

Currently, no country is recognized as ensuring an adequate level of protection.&nbsp;
The Republic of Moldova is not an EU member state. Thus, the standard clauses are not applicable as such. The Standard clauses may be used only as a data transfer agreement template and re quires amendment to the local requirements.Last modified 21 Feb 2022
