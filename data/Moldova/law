The main national legal acts regulating personal data protection in Moldova are:

the Constitution of the Republic of Moldova (Article 28);
the Law No. 133 of 08 July 2011 on Personal Data Protection;
the Law No. 182 of 10 July 2008 regarding the approval of the National Centre for Personal Data Protection regulation, structure, staff-limit and its financial arrangements;
the Government Decision No. 296 of 15 May 2012 on the approval of the Regulation regarding the Register of evidence of the personal data controllers;
the Governmental Decision No. 1123 of 14 December 2010 on the approval of the requirements for the assurance of personal data security and their processing within the information systems of personal data.&nbsp;&nbsp;

The law on Personal Data Protection is the core legal act establishing the legal framework of personal data protection in Moldova.&nbsp; It has been adopted to harmonize the national regulations with the provisions of the Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data.&nbsp;
In the near future we expect the adoption of a new Law on Personal Data Protection which will transpose the provisions of the GDPR with some adjustments to Moldovan conditions.&nbsp;
Please note that Moldova is not an EU country and European provisions on personal data protection are not directly applicable in Moldova.Last modified 21 Feb 2022
