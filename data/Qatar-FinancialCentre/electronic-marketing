Immediately upon collecting personal data, the DPL requires data controllers to provide data subjects who they have collected personal data from, with, among other things, any further information to the extent necessary (having regard to the specific circumstances in which the personal data is collected). This includes information on whether the personal data will be used for direct marketing purposes (DPL, Article 11).
If the personal data has not been obtained from the data subject, the data controller or their representative must at the time of undertaking the recording of personal data – or if it is envisaged that the personal data will be disclosed to a third party, no later than when the personal data is first recorded or disclosed – provide the data subject with, among other things, information regarding whether the personal data will be used for direct marketing purposes (DPL, Article 12).
Before personal data is disclosed for the first time to third parties or used on a data subject’s behalf for the purposes of direct marketing, data subjects also have the right to be informed and to be expressly offered the right to object to such disclosures or uses (DPL, Article 16(1)(B)).
Additionally, the DPL requires a data controller to record various types of information regarding its personal data processing operations (Article 17(1) and 2(A)). This must include an explanation of the purpose for the personal data processing (DPR, Article 4(1)(B)). The DPR suggests that one of these purposes may be for advertising, marketing and public relations for the data controller itself or for others (Article 4.1(e)).Last modified 17 Jan 2022
