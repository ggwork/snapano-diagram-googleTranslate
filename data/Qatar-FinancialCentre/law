The Qatar Financial Centre ("QFC"), a business center located on-shore in Qatar with its own regulations that are separate and distinct from those of the State of Qatar, implemented QFC Regulation No. 6 of 2005 on QFC Data Protection Regulations ("DPL").
Additionally, under the powers granted to the QFC Authority under Article 21 of the DPL, the QFC Authority has issued the Data Protection Rules 2005 (DPR).
The QFC has issued a consultation on amendments to the DPL and DPR. Although there is no specific timeframe on when the amendments to the DPL and DPR will be effective, we expect it will be reasonably soon. As a general comment, the proposed changes are largely well drafted, provide increased clarity around the DPL and DRP as well as creating certain new obligations and bring the QFC more closely in line with the position under the GDPR and other similar laws, which should assist international businesses in taking a relatively uniform approach to their data compliance activities.Last modified 17 Jan 2022
