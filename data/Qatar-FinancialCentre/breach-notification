There is no requirement under the DPL and nor the DPR to inform the QFC Authority of any breaches of personal data databases. It is nevertheless recommended that a data controller notifies the QFC Authority and the concerned data subjects of events of breach as soon as practicable and in any event, within 72 hours from the time the data controller becomes aware of such breach.Last modified 17 Jan 2022
