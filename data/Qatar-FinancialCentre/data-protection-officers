There is no requirement under the DPL or the DPR for organizations to appoint a data protection officer. Though note the general obligation of a data controller to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect personal data, as further detailed below (see Security section). It is however recommended that organizations that operates on a large scale or carries out regular and systematic monitoring of individuals appoint an individual responsible for overseeing the data controllerâ€™s compliance with data protection requirements.Last modified 17 Jan 2022
