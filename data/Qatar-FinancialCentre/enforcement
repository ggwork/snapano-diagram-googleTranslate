In the QFC, the ESO oversees the enforcement of the DPL.
If the QFC Authority is satisfied that a data controller has contravened or is contravening the DPL or DPR, the QFC Authority may issue a direction to the data controller requiring it to do either or both of the following:

To do or refrain from doing any act or thing within such time as may be specified in the direction (DPL, Article 22(1)(A))
To refrain from processing any personal data specified in the direction or to refrain from processing personal data for a purpose or in a manner specified in the direction (DPL, Article 22(1)(B))

A data controller may file an appeal against a decision by the QFC Authority to issue a direction pursuant to DPL, Article 22(1) at the QFC Tribunal (DPL, Article 22(3)).&nbsp;Last modified 17 Jan 2022
