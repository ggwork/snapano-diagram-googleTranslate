The personal information controller is required to promptly notify the NPC and the affected data subjects when it has reasonable belief that Sensitive Personal Information or other information has been acquired by an unauthorized person, and that:

such personal information may, under the circumstances, be used to enable identity fraud, and&nbsp;
the personal information controller or the NPC believes that such unauthorized acquisition is likely to give rise to a real risk of serious harm to any affected data subject.

The notification shall at least describe the nature of the breach, the sensitive personal information possibly involved, and the measures taken by the entity to address the breach.
Notification may be delayed only to the extent necessary to determine the scope of the breach, to prevent further disclosures, or to restore reasonable integrity to the information and communications system. The NPC may also authorize postponement of notification where such notification may hinder the progress of a criminal investigation related to a serious breach.
Notification is not required if the NPC determines:

that notification is unwarranted after taking into account compliance by the personal information controller with the Act and the existence of good faith in the acquisition of personal information, or
in the reasonable judgment of the NPC, such notification would not be in the public interest or in the interests of the affected data subjects.
