All persons engaged in the processing of personal data within and outside the Philippines shall appoint a Data Protection Officer (“DPO”).&nbsp;
Mandatory registration of data processing systems shall be required from a PIC or PIP if it is processing personal data and operating in the country under any of the following&nbsp;conditions:

the PIC or PIP employs at least two hundred fifty (250) employees;
the processing includes sensitive personal information of at least one thousand (1,000) individuals;
the processing is likely to pose a risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects. Processing operations that pose a risk to data subjects include those that involve:

information that would likely affect national security, public safety, public order, or public health;
information required by applicable laws or rules to be confidential;
vulnerable data subjects like minors, the mentally ill, asylum seekers, the elderly, patients, those involving criminal offenses, or in any other case where an imbalance exists in the relationship between a data subject and a PIC or PIP;
automated decision-making; or
profiling;


the processing is not occasional: Provided, that processing shall be considered occasional if it is only incidental to the mandate or function of the PIC or PIP, or, it only occurs under specific circumstances and is not regularly performed. Processing that constitutes a core activity of a PIC or PIP, or is integral thereto, will not be considered occasional: In determining the existence of the foregoing conditions, relevant factors, such as the number of employees, or the records of individuals whose sensitive personal information are being processed, shall only be considered if they are physically located in the Philippines. Data processing systems that involve automated decision-making shall, in all instances, be registered with the NPC. For all other data processing systems whereby the processing is likely to pose a risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects and is not occasional (as discussed above), the Commission shall determine the specific sectors, industries, or entities that shall be covered by mandatory registration.

The initial list of such sectors, industries, or entities, may be found here.&nbsp;
This list shall be regularly reviewed and may be updated by the NPC through subsequent issuances.
The NPC has yet to establish or develop a system that would enable the PIC or PIP to register their personal data processing systems with the NPC.Last modified 17 Dec 2021
