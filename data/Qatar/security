Specify the processors responsible for protecting the personal data
Train processors on the protection of personal data and raise their awareness relating to the same
Set up internal systems to receive and investigate complaints, data access requests, data correction or deletion requests and provide the data subjects with information relating to the same
Set up internal systems for the effective management of personal data, and report any violation of the same with the aim of safeguarding personal data
Adopt suitable technical means to enable individuals to exercise their rights to access, review and correct their personal data directly
Carry out comprehensive review and checking of the commitment to protect personal data
Verify that the data processor abides by the instructions given to him/her or take suitable precautions to protect personal data, and continually monitor that situation

The data controller and processor must take necessary precautions to protect personal data against loss, damage, amendment, disclosure or access thereto or use thereof in an accidental or unlawful way. The Data Protection Law states the precautions taken must be proportionate to the nature and importance of the personal data to be protected. Organizations should adopt best practice methodologies in keeping with their business sector.Last modified 17 Jan 2022
