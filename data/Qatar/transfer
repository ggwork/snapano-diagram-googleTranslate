Data controllers may collect, process and transfer personal data when the data subject consents, unless deemed necessary for realizing a 'lawful purpose' for the controller or for the third party to whom the personal data is sent. The data controller has to demonstrate, when disclosing and transferring personal data to the data processor, that the transfer is for a lawful purpose and that the transfer of data is made pursuant to the provisions of the Data Protection Law.
Data controllers should not take measures or adopt procedures that may curb trans-border data flow, unless processing such data violates the provisions of the Data Protection Law or will cause gross damage to the data subject. The Data Protection Law defines 'trans-border data flow' as accessing, viewing, retrieving, using or storing personal data without the constraints of state borders.Last modified 17 Jan 2022
