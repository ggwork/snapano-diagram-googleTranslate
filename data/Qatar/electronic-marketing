Unsolicited direct marketing is prohibited under the Data Protection Law, which requires prior consent to send electronic marketing communications (including by wired or wireless communication).&nbsp;The consent of the data subject must be affirmative, explicit and unambiguous. Indirect or implied consent by means of pre-ticked boxes may be deemed invalid.&nbsp;
All electronic marketing communications must include the identity of the sender and an indication that it is sent for the purpose of direct marketing. The message must include an address that can easily be reached and must enable the recipient to send a message requesting the sender to stop the electronic communication and enable the recipient to withdraw the consent at any time.Last modified 17 Jan 2022
