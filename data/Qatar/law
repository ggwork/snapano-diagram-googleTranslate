Qatar has implemented Law No. (13) of 2016 Concerning Personal Data Protection ("the Data Protection Law").&nbsp;
With its Data Protection Law – adopted in 2016 – Qatar became the first Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) member state to issue a generally applicable data protection law.
The Data Protection Law is supplemented with a set of regulatory guidelines issued by the Compliance and Data Protection Department. The guidelines incorporate concepts from EU privacy regulatory frameworks and seek to clarify obligations under, and address matters that are not deal with in, the Data Protection Law. The introduction of these guidelines provide a mechanism for which those subject to the Data Protection Law would be able to better understand their obligations under the Data Protection Law and comply with its provisions more fully.
The Data Protection Law applies to personal data when this data is any of the following:

Processed electronically
Obtained, collected or extracted in any other way in preparation for electronic processing&nbsp;
Processed by combining electronic processing and traditional processing

The Data Protection Law provides that each individual shall have the right to privacy of their personal data. Such data may only be processed within a framework of transparency, honesty, respect for human dignity and in accordance with the provisions of the Data Protection Law.Last modified 17 Jan 2022
