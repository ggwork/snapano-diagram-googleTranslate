The Data Protection Law specifically regulates online privacy processing data in relation to children. Owners and operators of websites must observe the followings requirements.
In relation to online privacy, data controllers must ensure they have in place a privacy notice to notify data subjects that they are processing personal data. A privacy notice must generally include the following information:

Details of the data controller including its legal name, registered address and contact information
Details regarding third-party processors if any and in which case, the privacy notice should, inter alia, provide a description of why the data processors are processing information on behalf of the data controller
The data controller's purposes for processing personal data including the permitted reasons for doing so
A comprehensive and accurate description of the processing activities
The levels of disclosure for the permitted reasons for processing personal data or a general description
Any other information that is necessary for fulfilling conditions of personal data processing for e.g., general information on how personal data is kept secure and a data subject's rights and how they may be exercised

In relation to websites relating to children, a data controller should:

Place a notification on the website regarding how children’s data is used and its disclosure policies
Obtain express approval from the parents or guardian of the child before processing any personal data
Provide the child’s parent or guardian—upon request and after verifying the identity of the child’s parent or guardian—a description of the personal data that is being processed, stating the purpose of the processing, and a copy of the child’s data that is being collected and processed
Delete, erase, or suspend the processing of any personal data that was collected from the child or about the child, if the child’s parent or guardian requests this, and
Refrain from making any child's participation in a game or prize offer, or any other activity conditional on the child's submission of personal data which goes beyond what is required for the purposes of participation in the game or prize offer
