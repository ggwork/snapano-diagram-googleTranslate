In late 2018, Serbia updated its data protection law to better align with the EU General Data Protection Regulation. Serbia enacted a new Data Protection Law on 9 November 2018 (published in the Official Gazette of the Republic of Serbia, no. 87/2018) (“DP Law”). Although the DP Law entered into force 21 November 2018, its effective date was postponed until 21 August 2019 (except for the maintenance of the Central Register of Personal Databases which has already been terminated).
The DP Law was long awaited, as it has been 10 years since the previous data protection law was passed. Its content is largely harmonized with the GDPR. It is now fully effective as of 21 August 2019.Last modified 17 Jan 2022
