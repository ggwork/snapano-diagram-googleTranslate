There are no specific regulations explicitly governing online privacy (including cookies). Accordingly, the general data protection rules, as introduced by the DP Law are, to the extent applicable, relevant for online privacy as well.
On the other hand, it should be noted that the EC Law, as defined in the section on&nbsp;Breach Notification&nbsp;above, introduces rules on the processing of traffic data and location data, which are obligatory for entities which are the Operators (as defined above in the section on&nbsp;Breach Notification) of public communication networks and publicly available electronic communication services. Under these rules, these Operators are allowed to do the following:

Process traffic data only as long as such data is necessary for a communication’s transmission and thus, when such necessity ceases to exist, the Operators are obliged (unless in the case when they have obtained prior consent of the data subjects for using the respective data for marketing purposes) to delete such data or to keep the data only if they take measures to make the data anonymous.
Generally process location data only if the persons to which the data relates are made unrecognizable or if they have such persons’ prior consent for the purpose of providing them with value added services (but even if such consent does exist, only in the scope and for the time during which the processing is needed for the respective purpose's realization).

Violations are subject to the fines set forth in Breach notification.Last modified 17 Jan 2022
