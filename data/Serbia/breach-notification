The DP Law imposes data breach notification obligations that largely track the GDPR. Furthermore, the Law on Electronic Communications ('Official Gazette of the Republic of Serbia', nos. 44/2010, 60/2013, 62/2014 and 95/2018) (“EC Law”) imposes a duty on entities which perform or are authorized to perform electronic communications' activities (Operators) to notify the Regulatory Agency for Electronic Communications and Postal Services (“RATEL”) as the competent state authority, of any breach of security and integrity of public communication networks and services, which have influenced their work significantly and particularly for breaches which resulted in the violation of protection of personal data or privacy of the respective networks / services' users / subscribers.
Nonperformance of this statutory obligation can lead to liability and fines of up to EUR 17,000 for a legal entity, and up to EUR 1,275 for a responsible person in a legal entity. Protective measures may also be implemented. For a legal entity, a prohibition against performing business activities for a duration of up to three years and for a responsible person in a legal entity, a prohibition against performing certain duties for a duration of up to one year.
According to the DP Law, the data breach obligations present a significant responsibility, as data controllers will generally be required to document each data breach as well as to notify the DPA of such breach (if it is likely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals) without undue delay and, when feasible, within 72 hours after becoming aware of the breach. In addition, data processors will have to notify the controllers of the breach without undue delay.
If the personal data breach is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals, the controller is also required to communicate the personal data breach to the individual concerned without undue delay. However, this does not apply if the controller has implemented appropriate technical and organizational measures, such as encryption that has rendered the relevant data unintelligible to any unauthorized person or, if the notification would involve disproportionate efforts, a public communication or a similar measure must be made in order to properly inform the individuals.Last modified 17 Jan 2022
