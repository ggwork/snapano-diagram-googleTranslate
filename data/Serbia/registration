The obligation for the maintenance of the Central Register of Personal Databases by the DPA, which existed under the previous data protection law, was terminated immediately upon the entering into force of the DP Law. Under the DP Law, controllers and processors are only required to internally maintain the database records and only if they have more than 250 employees or if they are involved in certain types of processing or process certain types of personal data (such as, for example, special categories of data or personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences). The latter two conditions are applicable regardless of the number of employees a processer or controller has.Last modified 17 Jan 2022
