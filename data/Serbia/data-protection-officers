According to the DP Law, controllers and processors are required to designate a data protection officer (“DPO”), whose primary task is to ensure compliance with the data processing law and regulations and to communicate with the DPA and the data subjects on all data protection matters. Similar to the GDPR, this obligation applies if the following criteria are met:

The processing is carried out by a public authority (with the exception of a court performing its judiciary authorizations).
The core activities of the controller / processor require the regular and systematic monitoring of data subjects on a large scale, or the large-scale processing of special categories of personal&nbsp;data — eg,&nbsp;health data or trade union memberships, or criminal convictions / offences data.

The DPO may be employed or engaged under a service contract, and in any case must have sufficient expert knowledge. A group of companies may appoint a single DPO, provided that he is equally accessible to each company.
Controllers and processors are required to ensure the DPO’s independence in the performance of his tasks. This means the following:

No instructions may be given to the DPO.
The DPO must report directly to the manager of the controller / processor.
The DPO may not be dismissed or penalized for performing his or her tasks.
