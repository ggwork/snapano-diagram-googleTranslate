Organisations are not required to appoint a data protection officer. However, the Data Protection Law provides that Data Controller and any person who processes the data must adopt internal rules and regulations on:&nbsp;

maintaining an information security; and
measures to be taken in case of data loss and a plan to deliver information to the Data Owner and the relevant state authority.&nbsp;

In this regard, organisations, as a Data Controller and processor, may appoint a data protection officer of their own volition.Last modified 23 Feb 2022
