Data protection fee
Section 24 DPR requires Controllers to pay a data protection fee to the Commissioner of Data Protection before, or as soon as reasonably practicable after, they start Processing Personal Data under the DPR.
It is also necessary to provide the Commissioner of Data Protection with:

name and address (which, in the case of a registered company, will be its registered office); and
Data Controllers must also establish and maintain records of any Personal Data Processing operations or set of such operations intended to secure a single purpose or several related purposes.

It is important to note that all licensed persons in the ADGM would have already provided the necessary information to the Commissioner of Data Protection during the company incorporation and registration Process. The date of incorporation is also the date the Controller may commence Processing Personal Data, such as the Personal Data of directors, shareholders and other statutory role holders. Each year, within one month of the expiry of the anniversary on which a Controller commenced Processing Personal Data under the DPR 20201 it is also necessary to pay the renewal fee.
The amounts payable are set out in the Data Protection Regulations 2021 (Fees) Rules 2021.
As per Section 28 DPR each Controller and Processor to which the DPR applies must maintain a record of Processing activities in writing. This can be in electronic form, but it does not necessarily need to be. The record of Processing activities must be made available to the Commissioner of Data Protection upon request.Last modified 5 Jan 2022
