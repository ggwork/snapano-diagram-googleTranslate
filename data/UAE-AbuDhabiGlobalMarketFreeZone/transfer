International transfers
The DPR restricts the transfer of Personal Data out of the ADGM to a jurisdiction outside of the ADGM, or to an international organisation. Transfer is interpreted broadly and covers not only an act of sending, but also making available Personal Data to an individual or organisation in another jurisdiction. This includes transfer to onshore UAE based recipients.
There are various ways in which Personal Data can be legitimately transferred outside of the ADGM. Those are as follows:

transfer on the basis of an adequacy decision. The list of adequate jurisdictions can be found online. Note that these may be updated from time to time as the Commissioner will monitor for any changes in law which could impact an adequacy decision. When making its assessment the Commissioner will take account of the factors set out at Section 41(2) DPR;
transfer on the basis of appropriate safeguards without the need for Commissioner approval for the transfer. Those include the following (provided always that the Controller or Processor has provided appropriate safeguards, and on condition that enforceable Data Subject rights and effective legal remedies for Data Subjects are available):

a legally binding and enforceable instrument between public authorities;
binding corporate rules (BCRs);
standard data protection clauses adopted by the Commissioner of Data Protection (available online). Those are broadly based on the recently issued EU SCCs;
a Commissioner approved code of conduct pursuant to Section 37 DPR together with binding and enforceable commitments of the Controller or Processor in the jurisdiction outside of ADGM to apply the appropriate safeguards, including as regards Data Subjects' rights; or
a Commissioner approved certification mechanism pursuant to Section 39 DPR together with binding and enforceable commitments of the Controller or Processor in the jurisdiction outside of ADGM to apply the appropriate safeguards, including as regards Data Subjects'.



The Commissioner does not require exporters relying on (i) – (v) above to conduct a detailed analysis of the laws of the importing jurisdiction, but recommends that exporters conduct due diligence on importing entities to ensure that they are capable of meeting their commitments under (i) – (v) above (as applicable).

where the Commissioner has given its approval to:

contractual clauses between the Controller or Processor and the Controller, Processor or the recipient of the Personal Data outside of ADGM or the international organisation; and
provisions to be inserted into administrative arrangements, including regulatory memorandums of understanding between public authorities or domestic or international bodies which include enforceable and effective Data Subject rights; or


transfers made on the basis of the set out under Section 44 DPR (some of which are subject to additional qualifications):

the Data Subject has explicitly consented to the proposed transfer, after having been informed of the possible risks of such transfers for the Data Subject due to the absence of an adequacy decision and appropriate safeguards;
the transfer is necessary for the performance of a contract between the Data Subject and the Controller or the implementation of pre-contractual measures taken at the Data Subject's request;
the transfer is necessary for the conclusion or performance of a contract concluded in the interest of the Data Subject between the Controller and another natural or legal person;
the transfer is necessary for important reasons of public interest;
the transfer is required by law enforcement agencies of the UAE in accordance with Applicable Law (as defined under the DPR);
the transfer is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims (including judicial, administrative, regulatory and out-of-court procedures); or
the transfer is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the Data Subject or of another person, where the Data Subject is physically or legally incapable of giving consent.
