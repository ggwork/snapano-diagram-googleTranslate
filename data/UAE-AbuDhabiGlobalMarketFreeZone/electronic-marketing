According to Part 2 of the Commissioner’s Guidance, it is not always necessary to seek consent under the DPR to conduct direct marketing activities, such as sending marking emails. In many cases, it will be possible to rely upon legitimate interests (Section 5(1)(f) DPR) as the relevant legal basis for Processing. If relying on legitimate interests, it is important to ensure that individuals are given the right to object both at the point at which their Personal Data is collected for direct marketing purposes, and within each communication (for example, by way of an “unsubscribe link” in an email). A pre-ticked box may be sufficient when offering the right to object at the point of data collection.
Whenever are relying on legitimate interests as the legal basis for Processing for direct marketing, consider whether the legitimate interests in conducting the marketing are overridden by the interests or rights of the Data Subject. Depending on the context of the direct marketing activities (for example, if the content of those marketing communications relates to products or services which are sensitive in some way, such as health related services), there may be instances where it will not be appropriate to rely on this as the relevant legal basis and consent would be more appropriate. Controllers must also ensure that they continue to meet their obligation to comply with the principles of transparency and fairness under Section 4 DPR by clearly describing their direct marketing activities in the applicable privacy notice.Last modified 5 Jan 2022
