Following a period of public consultation, on 14 February 2021 the Abu Dhabi Global Market ("ADGM") issued the ADGM Data Protection Regulations 2021 ("DPR"). The DPR replace the ADGM Data Protection Regulations 2015 (as amended). New establishments were give a six month window to adjust their compliance, whilst existing organisations were given 12 months, the DPR becoming fully enforceable from 14 February 2022. &nbsp;
An important feature of the new framework is the establishment of an independent Office of Data Protection, headed by a Commissioner of Data Protection.
In order to assist businesses in understanding the requirements DPR, and how those should be applied to their activities, in August 2021 the Office of Data Protection issued a suite of eight guidance documents which cover the following topics:

General overview;
Data subject rights
Data protection by design and default, fees, record of Processing activities (“ROPA”), data protection officers (“DPOs”) and Processor obligations;
Data protection impact assessments (“DPIAs”);
