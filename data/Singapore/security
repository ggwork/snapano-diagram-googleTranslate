Organizations must protect personal data in their possession or under their control by making reasonable security arrangements to prevent unauthorized access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification, disposal, the loss of any storage medium or device on which personal data is stored, or similar risks. Data intermediaries are also directly liable and subject to the same security obligation. The Act does not specify security measures to adopt and implement, however the Commission has issued best practice guidance which provides specific examples, including with respect to cloud computing and IT outsourcing.Last modified 21 Dec 2021
