In disclosing or transferring personal data to onshore third parties (including affiliates), an organization should ensure that it has obtained the individual's deemed or express consent to such transfer (unless exemptions apply) and, if this was not done at the time the data was collected, additional consent will be required (unless exemptions apply).
It is also a requirement under the Act for organizations to enter into written agreements with their data intermediaries to whom they transfer personal data and who process such data on behalf of the organizations.
The Act also contains offshore transfer restrictions, which require an organization to ensure that the receiving organization has in place "comparable protection" to the standards set out in the Act when transferring personal data outside of Singapore. Mechanisms to achieve this include (this is not a comprehensive list): data transfer agreements (for which the Commission has released including model clauses); the individual has given consent (and provided required notices have been provided); and where transfers are considered necessary in certain prescribed circumstances (which include in connection with performance of contracts between the transferring organization and the individual, subject to certain conditions being met). An organization may apply to be exempted from any requirement prescribed under the Act in respect of any transfer of personal data out of Singapore. An exemption may be granted on such conditions as the Commission may require.
The Amendment Act provides for a new right of data portability on electronic data (this right is expected to come into force no earlier than February 1, 2022). Individuals may request an organization ("Porting Organization") to transmit certain data about them to another organization. The Porting Organization must have an ongoing relationship with the individual, and have collected or created such data.
The Commission has published guides to data sharing (covering intragroup and third party sharing) with practical nonbinding guidance on data transfer / sharing for organizations, as well as DPMP and DPIA guides (see Collection &amp; Processing).Last modified 21 Dec 2021
