Currently, there are no specific requirements relating to online privacy (including cookies and location) under the Act. Nevertheless, an organization that wishes to engage in any online activity that involves the collection, use or disclosure of personal data will still need to comply with the general data protection obligations under the Act. For example, if an organization intends to use cookies to collect personal data, it must obtain consent before use of any such cookies. For details of the consent required, please see Collection &amp; Processing. The Commission has published nonbinding guidelines providing practical tips on pertinent topics such as securing electronic personal data, building websites, the capture of IP addresses and the use of cookies.Last modified 21 Dec 2021
