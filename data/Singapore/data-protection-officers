It is mandatory for each organization to appoint one or more DPOs to be responsible for ensuring the organization’s compliance with the Act. An organization may appoint one person or a team of persons to be its DPO. Once appointed, the DPO may in turn delegate certain responsibilities, including to non-employees of the organization. The business contact information of the DPO must be made available to the public. The DPO’s contact information may be made available to the public either through BizFile+ website&nbsp;(where the organisation is registered with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority) or provided in a readily accessible part of the organization's official website.
While there is no requirement for the DPO to be a citizen or resident in Singapore, the Commission suggests that the DPO should be readily contactable from Singapore, available during Singapore business hours and, where telephone numbers are provided, these should be Singapore telephone numbers.
Failure to appoint a DPO may lead to a preliminary investigation by the Commission. If an organization or an individual fails to cooperate with the investigation, this will constitute an offence. As a result, an individual may be subject to a fine of up to SGD 10,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months, or to both. An organization may be subject to a fine of up to SGD 100,000.Last modified 21 Dec 2021
