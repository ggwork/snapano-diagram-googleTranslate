There is no specific legislation with regards to on-line privacy (including cookies and location data). However, the LPPD considers location data and online identifiers as personal data (Article 3 (1) (1)). Accordingly, the processing data which fall within the definition of the LPPD, must be done in accordance with the provisions and principles of the LPPD.&nbsp;
Moreover, with reference to the location data, Law on Electronic Communications No.04/L-109 (“LEC”) stipulates that when location data are being processed, such data may be processed only if they are made anonymous or the users have given their consent for processing. In this line, Article 23 of LPPD provides the following: “taking into account the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well as the risks of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller shall implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure and to be able to demonstrate that processing is performed in accordance with this Law" (Article 89 LEC).Last modified 22 Dec 2021
