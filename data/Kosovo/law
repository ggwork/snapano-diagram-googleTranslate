The Law on Protection of Personal Data No.06/L-082 (“LPPD”) is the Kosovan law which entered into force and became applicable on 13 February 2019.&nbsp; The LPPD transposes the Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (“GDPR”).&nbsp;
Scope of application&nbsp;
The LPPD has a wide scope of application. Namely, the LPPD applies to (Article 2):

processing activities by private as well as public bodies;
processing of personal data in diplomatic and consular offices, including any representative office of Kosovo abroad.&nbsp;

The LPPD has extraterritorial scope in that it applies to data controllers not established in Kosovo, which for the purposes of processing personal data make use of automatic or other equipment in Kosovo; nevertheless, the LPPD will not apply if such equipment is used only for transit purposes through the territory of Kosovo (Article 2(2)).Last modified 22 Dec 2021
