Breach notification to the IPA&nbsp;
LPPD foresees a mandatory breach notification to the IPA by data controllers not later than seventy-two (72) hours after becoming aware of the breach, unless the personal data breach is unlikely to risk the rights and freedoms of natural persons (Article 33 (1) (1)). When the data controller fails to report the breach after the 72 hours of becoming aware of it, the notification to IPA must also contain reasons on delayed notification.
With regards to the processors, the LPPD states that they should notify the breach to IPA without undue delay (Article 33 (2)), however a specific deadline as in the case of controllers is not provided.&nbsp;
Breach notification to the Data Subject&nbsp;
The data subject is notified on any breach resulting in a high risk to his/her rights and freedoms, without undue delay (Article 34 (1)).&nbsp; The obligation to communicate the breach to the data subject will not apply, provided the following conditions are met (Article 34 (3)):

the controller has implemented appropriate technical and organisational protection measures, and those measures were applied to the personal data affected by the personal data breach, in particular those that render the personal data unintelligible to any person who is not authorised to access it, such as encryption;
the controller has taken subsequent measures which ensure that the high risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects (i.e. natural persons) is no longer likely to materialise;
it would involve disproportionate effort, whereby, there shall instead be a public communication or similar measure whereby the data subjects are informed in an equally effective manner.
