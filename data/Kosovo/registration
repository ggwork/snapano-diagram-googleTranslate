Considering that the LPPD transposes the GDPR, same as the latter, it provides meticulous and protective measures to which the Controllers and the Processors must comply, and as such does not impose restrictive registration or notification requirements to be undertaken with the IPA. Accordingly, in general, LPPD does not contain mandatory provisions requiring registration of processing activities.&nbsp;
Nevertheless, controller and processor, including entities which process personal data based on the LPPD, are required to obtain the certification to perform work related to personal data (Article 43(1)).&nbsp;
In order to obtain certification, controllers, processors and legal entities must meet the following minimum criteria (Article 43(3)):

possession of adequate knowledge in the field of persona data protection;
where required, meet the necessary international safety standards;
when legal entities engage a controller or processor or other personnel, the latter must be certified;
prove that the exercise of their function pertaining to the protection of personal data, does not result in a conflict of interest.&nbsp;

In practice, the certification procedure is not applicable in Kosovo, and its implementation is subject to the adoption of a sub-legal act (Article 43 (2)).Last modified 22 Dec 2021
