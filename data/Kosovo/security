LPPD contains general provisions when it comes to safety of processing of personal data. Security of processing of personal data refers to adopting appropriate organisational, technical and logical-technical procedures and measures in order to prevent any accidental, deliberate unauthorised destruction, disclosure, modification, etc. Implementing security measures is carried out by (Article 31 (1)):

Pseudonymization and encryption of personal data;
The ability to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of processing systems and services;
The ability to restore the availability and access to personal data in a timely manner in the event of a physical or technical incident;
A process for regularly testing, assessing and evaluating the effectiveness of technical and organisational measures for ensuring the security of the processing.&nbsp;

The above measures of security are not sector-specific and apply to the processing of personal data in general.Last modified 22 Dec 2021
