Until recently, Uzbekistan did not have a stand-alone personal data protection law. The situation changed with the adoption on 2 July 2019 of the Law of the Republic of Uzbekistan No. ZRU-547 “On Personal Data” (“Law on Personal Data”), which entered into force on 1 October 2019.
With the entry into force of the Law on Personal Data, a unified set of main rules and requirements in the area of data protection and processing that is aimed at substantial regulation of these issues was introduced in Uzbekistan.
The scope of application of this Law is rather broad, as it applies to relations arising from processing and protection of personal data, regardless of the applied means of processing, including information technologies.
Apart from the Law on Personal Data, there are certain legal acts that establish fundamental principles of data protection processing and / or set liability for violation of data protection rules. They include:

Constitution of the Republic of Uzbekistan entered into force on December 8, 1992; 
Civil Code of the Republic of Uzbekistan entered into force on 1 March 1997;
Labour Code of the Republic of Uzbekistan entered into force on 1 April 1996;
Code of the Republic of Uzbekistan on Administrative Liability entered into force on 1 April 1995 (‘Code on Administrative Liability’);
Criminal Code of the Republic of Uzbekistan entered into force 1 April 1995 (‘Criminal Code’);
Law No. 439-II 'On Principles and Guarantees of Freedom of Information' dated December 12, 2002; 
Law No. 560-II 'On Informatization' dated December 11, 2003.

Lastly, there are also sector-specific laws applicable depending on the type of industry. Data protection regulation exists mainly in financial, telecommunication, health and insurance sectors and consists of the following legal acts:

Law No. 530-II 'On Bank Secrecy' dated August 30, 2003, under which a bank is prohibited to disclose bank secrecy, and should guarantee its protection
Law No. 822-I 'On Telecommunications' dated August 20, 1999, under which all operators and service providers are obliged to ensure the secrecy of communications
Law No. 265-I 'On Protection of Citizens’ Health' dated August 29, 1996, under which the medical secrecy is protected
Law No. 358-II 'On Insurance Activities' dated April 5, 2002, under which insurance companies should guarantee the confidentiality of information which became available in course of provision of insurance services.
