The Law on Personal Data states that personal data is subject to the protection guaranteed by the State. It also imposes obligations on the owner / operator of personal data and the third party acquiring personal data to take necessary legal, organizational and technical measures ensuring:

non-interference into the subject's private life;
integrity and safety of personal data;
confidentiality of personal data;
prevention of illegal processing of personal data.

The Law on Personal Data does not envisage the precise types and content of such measures. Yet, it authorizes the Cabinet of Ministers to define the requirements for protection of personal data during the processing and requirements for material carriers of biometric and genetic data for storing such data outside personal databases. There is no information with regards to the scheduled date of adoption of the above requirements. Until that moment, the owner / operator of personal data should determine such measures independently provided they are in line with data protection laws.
Obligations of the owner / operator of personal data on protection of confidentiality of personal data arise from the moment such data is collected until their destruction or depersonalization.Last modified 21 Feb 2022
