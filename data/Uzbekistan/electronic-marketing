The Law No. ZRU-385 of the Republic of Uzbekistan 'On E-Commerce' (new version) dated May 22, 2015 contains a provision on the use of personal data in e-commerce and electronic marketing. It requires obtaining prior consent of a data subject for distribution of the offer and advertising, including through mass distribution of electronic messages.
The Law on Personal Data does not specifically regulate the use of personal data in electronic marketing. However, considering that the Law on Personal Data applies to any processing of personal data this Law will also cover processing of personal data in electronic marketing.Last modified 21 Feb 2022
