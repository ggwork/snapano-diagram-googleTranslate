There is no general registration requirement under Canadian Privacy Statutes.
Some registration requirements exist under Quebec privacy laws:

Personal information agents, defined as “any person who, on a commercial basis, personally or through a representative, establishes files on other persons and prepares and communicates to third parties credit reports”, must be registered with the CAI
Databases of biometric information must be disclosed to and registered with the CAI
