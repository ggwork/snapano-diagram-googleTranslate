Electronic marketing is governed by both Canadian Privacy Statutes (as discussed ‎above), as well as Canada’s Anti-Spam Legislation (CASL).‎
Under CASL it is prohibited to send, or cause or permit to be sent, a commercial ‎electronic message (defined broadly to include text, sound, voice, or image messages ‎aimed at encouraging participation in a commercial activity) unless the recipient has ‎provided express or implied consent and the message complies with the prescribed ‎content and unsubscribe requirements (subject to limited exceptions).‎
What constitutes both permissible express and implied consent is defined in the Act and ‎regulations.&nbsp; For example, an organization may be able to rely on implied consent when ‎there is an existing business relationship with the recipient of the message, based on:‎

A purchase by the recipient within the past two years, or
A contract between the organization and the recipient currently in existence or which ‎expired within the past two years

CASL also prohibits the installation of a computer program on any other person's ‎computer system, or having installed such a computer program to cause any electronic ‎messages to be sent from that computer system, without express consent, if the ‎relevant system or sender is located in Canada. In addition, the Act contains anti ‎phishing provisions that prohibit (without express consent) the alteration of transmission ‎data in an electronic message such that the message is delivered to a destination other ‎than (or in addition to) that specified by the sender.‎
CASL also introduced amendments to PIPEDA that restrict 'address harvesting', or the ‎unauthorized collection of email addresses through automated means (i.e., using a ‎computer program designed to generate or search for, and collect, email addresses) ‎without consent. The use of an individual’s email address collected through address ‎harvesting also is restricted.‎
The 'Competition Act' was also amended to make it an offence to provide false or ‎misleading representations in the sender information, subject matter information, or ‎content of an electronic message.‎
CASL contains potentially stiff penalties, including administrative penalties of up to ‎CA$1 million per violation for individuals and CA$10 million for corporations (subject to a ‎due diligence defense). CASL also sets forth a private right of action permitting ‎individuals to bring a civil action for alleged violations of CASL (CA$200 for each ‎contravention up to a maximum of CA$1 million each day for a violation of the ‎provisions addressing unsolicited electronic messages). However, the private right of ‎action is not yet in force, and there is currently little expectation that it will ever come into force.‎Last modified 24 Jan 2022
