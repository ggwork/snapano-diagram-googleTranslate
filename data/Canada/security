Each of the Canadian Privacy Statutes contains safeguarding provisions designed to protect personal information. In essence, these provisions require organizations to take reasonable technical, physical and administrative measures to protect personal information against loss or theft, unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, modification or destruction. These laws do not generally mandate specific technical requirements for the safeguarding of personal information.Last modified 24 Jan 2022
