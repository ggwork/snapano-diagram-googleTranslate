PIPEDA, PIPA Alberta, and PIPA BC expressly require organizations to appoint an individual responsible for compliance with the obligations under the respective statutes.
Starting September 22, 2023, the Quebec Privacy Act, as modified by Bill 64, will require organizations to appoint a person responsible for the protection of personal information, who is in charge of ensuring compliance with privacy laws within the organization. By default, the person with the highest authority within the organization will be the person responsible for the protection of personal information, however this function can be delegated to any person, including a person outside of the organization.
This person’s responsibilities are broadly defined in the law and include:

Approval of the organization’s privacy policy and ‎practices
Mandatory privacy assessments
Responding to and reporting security breaches, and
Responding to and enacting access and ‎rectification rights

The contact information of the person responsible for the protection of personal information must be published online on the website of the organization.Last modified 24 Jan 2022
