Directive 2002/58 (E-Privacy Directive) is transposed into the Bulgarian Electronic Commerce Act. In 2011 the intention of the legislator was to introduce the amendments of Art. 5(3) under Directive 2009/136. However, the final adopted text still replicates the old wording before Directive 2009/136. The amendment itself was widely interpreted as implementing the text of Directive 2009/136 without, however, introducing the updated text.
Currently, instead of requiring the user's consent, the relevant text in the Electronic Commerce Act states that users should be provided with clear and comprehensive information in accordance with Art.13 of the GDPR and they must be given the opportunity to refuse the storage or access to such information (i.e. opt-out regime).Last modified 22 Dec 2021
