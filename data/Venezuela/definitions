Definition of Personal Data
There is no legal definition of “Personal Data” in Venezuelan legislation.&nbsp;
Nonetheless, decision No. 855 of the TSJ, of May 8, 2012, gave us the following definition of Personal Data: “Any information related to an identified or identifiable individual”.&nbsp;
Likewise, any Personal Data must be processed fairly and responsibly for particular purposes, on the basis of the data subject's consent or as a consequence of some other legitimate basis, provided &nbsp;by law.
Definition of Sensitive Personal Data
There is no legal definition of “Sensitive Personal Data” in Venezuelan legislation.&nbsp;
However, in decision No. 1335 of the TSJ, of August 8, 2011, in a case on the sensitive and personal data in a medical record, the TSJ expressed that any such data must be handled under the strictest confidentiality and privacy controls, and its content must not be disclosed.&nbsp;
The decision says that sensitive and personal data is a person’s most genuine and authentic assets, and, as such, is the absolute owner and holder of all that information, only that person can grant permission for its use and treatment.&nbsp;
Under this decision, we can conclude that any person’s intimate data can also be considered to be Sensitive Personal Data, and, as such, must be confidential, be duly guarded and only that person can grant permission for its use and treatment.Last modified 22 Dec 2021
