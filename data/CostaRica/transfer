The transfer of personal information is authorized by the Laws if the data subject provides prior, unequivocal, express and valid written consent to the company that manages the database. Such transfers cannot violate the principles and rights granted in the Laws. Also, there are specific limitations regarding cross-border transfers of personal information.
The transfer of personal information from the person responsible for a database to a service supplier, technological intermediary, or entities in the same economic interest group is not considered a transfer of personal information and thus does not need authorization from the data subject. Also, the transfer of public information (which can be generally accessed) does not need authorization from the data subject.Last modified 24 Jan 2022
