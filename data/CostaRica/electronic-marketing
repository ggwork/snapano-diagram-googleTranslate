General rules of data protection will apply. There is little to no regulation of electronic marketing.
Notwithstanding the above, the Telecommunications Act set the scope and the mechanisms of regulation for telecommunications (including e-marketing), by describing the data subjectâ€™s rights, interests and privacy protection policy. Therefore, pursuant to such Act, marketing companies may not advertise via phone nor email unless they obtain prior and express written consent from the data subject. If such companies do not comply with such condition, they might be sanctioned with a fine that can be between 0,025% and 0,5% of the income of the company of the last fiscal year.Last modified 24 Jan 2022
