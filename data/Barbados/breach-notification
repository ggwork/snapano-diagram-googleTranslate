Mandatory breach notification
Where there is a personal data breach the data controller must without&nbsp;undue delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours after having become&nbsp; aware of it, notify the personal data breach to the Commissioner, unless the&nbsp;personal data breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of&nbsp;an individual.&nbsp;
Where a personal data breach is likely to result in a high risk to the&nbsp;rights and freedoms of individuals, the data controller must communicate the&nbsp;personal data breach to the data subject without undue delay and, where feasible,&nbsp;not later than 72 hours after having become aware of it.Last modified 10 Jan 2022
