Where the Commissioner is satisfied that a data controller or a data&nbsp;processor has contravened or is contravening this Act, the Commissioner may&nbsp;serve him an "enforcement notice".&nbsp;
In deciding whether to serve an enforcement notice, the Commissioner must consider whether the contravention has caused or is likely to cause any person damage or distress.Last modified 10 Jan 2022
