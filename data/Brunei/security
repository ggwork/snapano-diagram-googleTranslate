It is anticipated that under the PDPO, an organization must protect personal data in its possession or under its control by making reasonable security arrangements to prevent:

unauthorized access, collection, use, disclosure, copying, modification, disposal or similar risks; and
the loss of any storage medium or device on which personal data is stored.

It is anticipated that under the PDPO data intermediaries will also be subjected to the same obligation to protect personal data in their possession.
It is anticipated that the PDPO will provide for a reasonable standard for such security measures taking into account factors such as the nature and sensitivity of the data, the form in which personal data is stored and the impact to the individual if the personal data is subject to unauthorized access, disclosure or other risks. But it is not anticipated that the PDPO will stipulate specific security measures to be adopted and implement by organizations and data intermediaries.Last modified 17 Dec 2021
