It is anticipated that under the PDPO, an organization shall not transfer personal data to a country outside Brunei Darussalam except in accordance with requirements prescribed under the PDPO to ensure that the transferred personal data will be accorded a standard of protection that is comparable to that under the PDPO. &nbsp;It is not anticipated that such requirement prescribed by the PDPO will be as stringent and prescriptive as in other jurisdiction, for example the EU, and it is anticipated that the PDPO will place the onus on organizations to ensure that appropriate measures are taken to protect personal data transferred out of Brunei Darussalam through the imposition of contractual obligations or otherwise.Last modified 17 Dec 2021
