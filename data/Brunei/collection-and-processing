At present not a regulated activity.
Under the PDPO framework set out in the Public Consultation Paper, organizations may collect, use or disclose personal data about an individual for purposes that a reasonable person would consider appropriate in the circumstance.
It is anticipated that under the PDPO organizations may collect, use or disclose personal data where –

they have the prior consent of the individual; or
unless otherwise required or authorized by law; or
an exception in the PDPO applies.

Where consent is required, it is anticipated that the PDPO will not specifically prescribe the manner in which consent may be given and that the PDPO will recognize that consent may be explicit or implicit through an individual’s actions or inactions, depending on the circumstances, and thereby allowing organizations flexibility as to how they obtain consent. That said, it is anticipated that the PDPO would require organizations to look to express consent as the first port of call and only rely on deemed consent or the exceptions to consent if obtaining consent is impractical or if they have otherwise failed to obtain express consent.
It is anticipated that under the PDPO consent must be validly obtained and consent would not be valid where:

consent is obtained as a condition of providing a product or service and such consent is beyond what is reasonable to provide the product or service to the individual; the principle being that organizations should not collect more personal data than is reasonable and necessary; and
where false or misleading information was provided in order to obtain or attempt to obtain the individual’s consent for collecting, using or disclosing his personal data.&nbsp; &nbsp;

As part of obtaining valid consent, it is anticipated that the PDPO will require organizations to provide the individual with information on:

the purposes for the collection, use or disclosure of his personal data, on or before collecting the personal data; and
any other purpose for the use or disclosure of personal data that has not been notified to the individual, before such use or disclosure of personal data.&nbsp;

Further, it is anticipated that fresh consent would be required where personal data collected is to be used for a different purpose from which the individual originally consented.Last modified 17 Dec 2021
