The Law on Protection of Personal Data, Official Journal of Montenegro, nos. 79/2008, 70/2009, 44/2012 and 22/2017, (DP Law) is the governing data protection law. It was first enacted in December 2008 and last amended in April of 2017.
The Montenegrin Parliament is expected to adopt a new Data Protection Law to harmonize its data protection law with the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). However, there is no certainty when exactly, i.e. within which timeframe such adoption (and further implementation) should occur.Last modified 17 Jan 2022
