Under the DP Law, personal data may be transferred to countries or international organizations, where an adequate level of personal data protection exists, subject to the DPA's approval. The DPA issues such approval only where it establishes that adequate measures for the protection of personal data are undertaken (criteria for the adequacy assessment include, for example, the type of the data and the statutory rules in force in the country to which the data is to be transferred).
However, in certain cases the DPA's approval is not required for data transfers out of Montenegro, as explicitly prescribed by the DP Law (eg, if the data subject consented to the transfer and was made aware of possible consequences of such transfer, or the data is transferred to the European Union or European Economic Area or to any country that the EU Commission has determined ensure adequate level of the data protection).Last modified 17 Jan 2022
