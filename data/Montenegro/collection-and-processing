A prerequisite for the legitimate processing of personal data is to obtain the data subjectâ€™s valid, informed consent. The consent requirements are explicitly described in the DP Law (eg, data subjects have to be informed about the purpose and legal basis for the respective processing). The processing of personal data without consent is only allowed under the exceptions listed in the DP Law, (eg, if the processing is necessary to meet the data controller's statutory obligations under the law or for the protection of life and other vital interests of the data subject who is not capable to personally consent).
As a general matter, in order to comply with the provisions under the DP Law, the processing has to be done in a fair and lawful manner, the type and scope of processed data must be proportionate to the purpose of the respective processing, the data should not be retained longer than necessary in order to meet the defined purpose, and the data has to be accurate, complete and up-to-date.Last modified 17 Jan 2022
