There is no data security breach notification requirement under the DP Law. However, the Law on Electronic Communications ('Official Journal of Montenegro', nos. 40/2013, 56/2013, 2/2017 and 49/2019) ('EC Law') does impose a duty on operators to, without undue delay, notify the Montenegrin Agency for Electronic Communications and Postal Activity (EC Agency) and the DPA of any breach of personal data or privacy of the data subjects. The affected data subject should also be notified if the breach may have a detrimental effect to their personal data or privacy (unless the EC Agency issues an opinion that such notification is not needed). Failure to comply with any of the above duties is subject to liability and fines, ranging from EUR 6,000 to EUR 30,000 for a legal entity, and from EUR 300 to EUR 3,000 for a responsible person within a legal entity, and, if some material gain was obtained through the violation, the protective measure, which includes seizure of the respective gain, may be imposed in addition to the above monetary fine.Last modified 17 Jan 2022
