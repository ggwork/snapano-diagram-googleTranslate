The DP Law requires that both data controllers and processors undertake technical, personnel and organizational measures for the protection of personal data against loss, destruction, unauthorized access, alteration, publication and misuse. Further, individuals who process personal data are required to keep the processed personal data confidential.
Additionally, data controllers are required to establish internal rules regarding their personal data processing and protection of same (which should include identifying the measures undertaken). Data controllers should also determine which employees have access to the processed data (and to which of this data), as well as the types of data which may be disclosed to other users (and the conditions for the respective disclosure). Finally, if the processing is performed electronically, a data controller is required to ensure that certain information on the use and recipients of the respective data, is automatically kept in the information system.Last modified 17 Jan 2022
