Direct marketing by means of an automated calling machine, a fax machine, email or a similar technology, which uses, in any form whatsoever, an individuals' data without their express prior consent to receive direct prospecting is prohibited.
However, direct marketing via email may be allowed if the recipientâ€™s email address has been received directly from him / her.
In the absence of consent, unwanted emails can only be sent if all of the following conditions are satisfied:

The contact details were provided in the course of a sale


The marketing relates to a similar product


The recipient was given a method to opt out of the use of their contact details for marketing when they were collected
