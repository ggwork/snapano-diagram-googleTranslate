Article 23 of the DP Law provides that an organization is required to implement all technical and organizational measures to protect personal data in order to prevent it being damaged, altered or used by a third party who is not authorized to have access, as well as to protect it against any form of illicit processing.
Additionally, in appointing processors and subcontractors an organization must choose a processor or subcontractor who provides sufficient guarantees with regard to the technical and organizational measures relating to the processing to be carried out while ensuring compliance with these measures.
