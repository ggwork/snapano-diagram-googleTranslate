Security
The GDPR is not prescriptive about specific technical standards or measures. Rather, the GDPR adopts a proportionate, context-specific approach to security. Article 32 states that controllers and processors shall implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk of the processing. In so doing, they must take account of the state of the art, the costs of implementation, and the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing. A 'one size fits all' approach is therefore the antithesis of this requirement.
However the GDPR does require controllers and processors to consider the following when assessing what might constitute adequate security:

the pseudonymization and encryption of personal data;
the ability to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of processing systems and services;
the ability to restore the availability and access to personal data in a timely manner in the event of a physical or technical incident; and
a process for regularly testing, assessing and evaluating the effectiveness of technical and organizational measures for ensuring the security of the processing.
The BDSG has additional rules regarding the processing of special categories of personal data in Sec. 22 (2) BDSG. In case of processing of such data, appropriate and specific measures have to be taken to safeguard the interests of the data subject.
Taking into account the state of the art, the cost of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well as the risks of varying likelihood and severity for rights and freedoms of natural persons posed by the processing, these measures may include in particular the following:

technical and organizational measures to ensure that processing complies with the GDPR
measures to ensure that it is subsequently possible to verify and establish whether and by whom personal data were input, altered or removed
measures to increase awareness of staff involved in processing operations
designation of a data protection officer
restrictions on access to personal data within the controller and by processors
the pseudonymization of personal data
the encryption of personal data
measures to ensure the ability, confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of processing systems and services related to the processing of personal data, including the ability to rapidly restore availability and access in the event of a physical or technical incident
a process for regularly testing, assessing and evaluating the effectiveness of technical and organizational measures for ensuring the security of the processing
specific rules of procedure to ensure compliance with this Act and with the GDPR in the event of transfer or processing for other purposes
