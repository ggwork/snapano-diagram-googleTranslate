The General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) (GDPR) is a European Union law which entered into force in 2016 and, following a two-year transition period, became directly applicable law in all Member States of the European Union on May 25, 2018, without requiring implementation by the EU Member States through national law.
A Regulation (unlike the Directive which it replaced) is directly applicable and has consistent effect in all Member States. However, there remain more than 50 areas covered by GDPR where Member States are permitted to legislate differently in their own domestic data protection laws, and there continues to be room for different interpretation and enforcement practices among the Member States.
Territorial Scope
Primarily, the application of the GDPR turns on whether an organization is established in the EU. An 'establishment' may take a wide variety of forms, and is not necessarily a legal entity registered in an EU Member State.
However, the GDPR also has extra-territorial effect. An organization that it is not established within the EU will still be subject to the GDPR if it processes personal data of data subjects who are in the Union where the processing activities are related "to the offering of goods or services" (Article 3(2)(a)) (no payment is required) to such data subjects in the EU or "the monitoring of their behaviour" (Article 3(2)(b)) as far as their behaviour takes place within the EU.As a member of the European Union, Poland implemented the EU Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC in the Personal Data Protection Act of August 29, 1997 (consolidated text: Journal of Laws of 2016, item 922, “previous PDPA”).
In relation to the Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, and repealing Directive 95/46/EC (“GDPR”), on September 12, 2017, two draft acts on personal data protection law were published in Poland. The first one was the draft of the new Personal Data Protection Act of 10 May 2018 (Journal of Laws of 2019, item 1781 (“PDPA”) which came into force on May 25, 2018, while the second was the Act on the amendments to sectorial acts accompanying the GDPR of 21 February 2019, containing amendments to over 160, sectorial regulations, including banking, insurance and labour law (Journal of Laws of 2019, item 730 “Implementing act”), which came into force on 4 May 2019.
The two new pieces of legislation are aimed at implementing the GDPR into the Polish legal order, as well as regulating the matters in which the GDPR leaves a certain regulatory freedom for EU Member States. The new PDPA establishes a new supervisory body – the President of the Office for Personal Data Protection (hereinafter referred to as the “Polish DPA”), which has a much wider range of powers than the previous DPA (Inspector General for the Protection of Personal Data&nbsp;– hereinafter referred to as the Inspector General).
A number of provisions of the Telecommunications Act of 16 July 2004 (consolidated text: Journal of Laws 2018, item 1954, hereinafter referred to as the “Telecommunications Act”) are applicable to the processing of personal data by providers of publicly available telecommunications services and a number of sector specific statutes relating to, among others, employment and banking matters also contain specific regulations on the processing of personal data.
The amendments to the sectorial regulations included in the Implementing act affected, among others, employment, banking and insurance regulations. The act has been passed on February 21, 2019 and entered into force on May 4, 2019.
