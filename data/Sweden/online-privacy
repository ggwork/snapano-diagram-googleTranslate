Pursuant to the Swedish Electronic Communications Act (as amended by e-Privacy Directive 2009/12/EC), a cookie may be stored on a user’s terminal equipment, only if the user has been given access to information for the purpose of the processing and given his or her consent, i.e. the user must give his/her prior ‘opt-in’ consent before a cookie is placed on the user’s computer. In its judgment of 1&nbsp;October 2019, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) decided on cookie consent requirements&nbsp;and stated that cookie consent must be given by a statement or clear affirmative action (consent cannot be validly obtained through pre-ticked checkboxes).
Consent is, however, not required for cookies that are:

used for the sole purpose of carrying out the transmission of communication over an electronic communications network; or
necessary for the provision of a service explicitly requested by the user.

Wilful or negligent breach of the Swedish Electronic Communications Act in this regard is sanctioned with fines, provided that the offence is not sanctioned by the Swedish Criminal Code (Sw. brottsbalken). However, if the breach is deemed to be minor, no sanction shall be imposed. To our knowledge there has been no case where a website operator has been fined for breach of the Swedish Electronic Communications Act.
Sweden has set the digital age of consent as 13 in relation to information society services.Last modified 17 Jan 2022
