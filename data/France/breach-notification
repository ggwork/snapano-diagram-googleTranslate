The GDPR contains a general requirement for a personal data breach to be notified by the controller to its supervisory authority, and for more serious breaches to also be notified to affected data subjects. A "personal data breach" is a wide concept, defined as any "breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to, personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed" (Article 4).
The controller must notify a breach to the supervisory authority without undue delay, and where feasible, not later than 72 hours after having become aware of it, unless the controller determines that the breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons. When the personal data breach is likely to result in a high risk to natural persons, the controller is also required to notify the affected data subjects without undue delay (Article 34).
Where the breach occurs at the level of the processor, it is required to notify the controller without undue delay upon becoming aware of the breach (Article 33(2)).
The notification to the supervisory authority must include where possible the categories and approximate numbers of individuals and records concerned, the name of the organization’s data protection officer or other contact, the likely consequences of the breach and the measures taken to mitigate harm (Article 33(3)).
Controllers are also required to keep a record of all data breaches (Article 33(5)) (whether or not notified to the supervisory authority) and permit audits of the record by the supervisory authority.The Decree restricts the obligation of notification under Article 34 of the GDPR for the following processing:

Processing including personal data allowing to identify, directly or indirectly, individuals whose identity is protected under Article 39 sexies of the French law on the freedom of the press; and
Administrative, financial and operational data, as well as health data processing for which the notification of an unauthorized disclosure or access is likely to result in a risk for the national security, defense or public, due to the volume of data affected by the breach and the private information it contains (such as the family address or composition).

The Law provides that a Decree by the State Council, adopted after seeking the CNIL’s opinion (yet to be adopted) will specify a list of categories of processing and processing operations that derogate to the data breach notification requirement. Such derogation will only apply to processing that are necessary pursuant to a legal obligation bearing on the data controller or a public interest mission vested in the data controller, where such data breach notification would likely result in a risk to homeland security, defense or public safety.
