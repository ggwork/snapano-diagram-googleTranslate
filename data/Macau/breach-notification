The Law does not require data controllers to notify either the OPDP or data subjects about any personal data breach.
However, a new Law on Cybersecurity came into effect in 2019, which implemented the requirement to notify the Cybersecurity Incident Alert and Response Center (CARIC) and respective regulatory authority, in the event of a system breach â€“ this obligation is, however, limited to operators of critical infrastructures.Last modified 22 Nov 2021
