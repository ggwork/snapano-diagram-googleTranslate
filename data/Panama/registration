The Data Protection Law does not include any registration or notification requirement prior to the processing of data before Panama’s National Authority of Transparency and Access to Information (“ANTAI”). What it does require, is for data controller’s (known in Panama as the “Responsible of the data treatment”) (Responsable del tratamiento de datos in Spanish) to have the data subject’s consent to the processing of said personal data, as a general principle.Last modified 24 Jan 2022
