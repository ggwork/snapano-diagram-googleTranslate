Not specifically required under data protection law.
Failure to notify a data security breach is not in itself a violation of the data protection regime, but may bear on the effects of security violation, especially if lack of such notification results in other security breaches or damages. The person responsible for the data must keep records on security breaches, and these records may be requested by the data protection authority.
Breach notification may be mandatory if the data protection authority specifically requests information about data breaches.Last modified 24 Jan 2022
