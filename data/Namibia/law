Namibia has not enacted comprehensive data privacy legislation. However, various sector-specific laws are in place to protect client information, including in the legal and banking sectors.&nbsp;
Namibia recognizes the right to privacy as a fundamental human right under Article 13 of the Namibian Constitution. Accordingly, all persons have a right to privacy in their homes and communications. The right to privacy is limited as required by law and in the interest of protecting:&nbsp;

national security and public safety
the nation’s economy
health and morals
against disorder and crime
the rights and freedoms of others&nbsp;

The Namibian Government is currently drafting a Data Protection Policy that, although not yet public, is expected to:&nbsp;

protect the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons, and in particular their right to privacy with respect to data processing
protect Namibian citizens from abuse of their personal data, and
harmonize Namibia’s data protection policy and legal framework with regional and international standards to promote the free flow of personal data under conditions of assurance and trust
