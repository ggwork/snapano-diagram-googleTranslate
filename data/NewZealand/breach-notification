Under the Act, any 'privacy breach' which it is reasonable to believe has caused or is likely to cause serious harm to an individual must be notified to the Privacy Commissioner and to the affected individuals.
A 'privacy breach' is any unauthorised or accidental access to, or disclosure, alteration, loss, or destruction of, personal information, or any action that prevents the agency from accessing the information on either a temporary or permanent basis.
When assessing whether a privacy breach is likely to cause serious harm, agencies must consider:

any action taken by the agency to reduce the risk of harm following the breach
whether the personal information is sensitive in nature
the nature of the harm that may be caused to affected individuals
the person or body that has obtained or may obtain personal information as a result of the breach (if known)
whether the personal information is protected by a security measure, and
any other relevant matters&nbsp;

Agencies must notify the Privacy Commissioner and affected individuals as soon as practicable after becoming aware of a notifiable privacy breach. If it is not reasonably practicable to notify an affected individual or each member of a group of affected individuals, an agency can give a public notice of the breach.&nbsp;
Notification to affected individuals is not required or can be delayed in certain circumstances. &nbsp;For example, notification to affected individuals can be delayed if the agency believes that a delay is necessary because notification or public notice may pose risks for the security of personal information held by the agency and those risks outweigh the benefits of informing affected individuals (for example, if notification of the breach would expose an unremedied security vulnerability).
Anyone who outsources services that involve data processing should be aware that the Act includes an express provision that anything relating to a notifiable privacy breach that is known by an agent is to be treated as being known by the principal agency. This is because the legislators consider that the principal agency should be responsible for informing individuals about a notifiable breach.Last modified 20 Dec 2021
