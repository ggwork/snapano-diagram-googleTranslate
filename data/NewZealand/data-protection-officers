The Act requires each agency to appoint one or more individuals to be a privacy officer. The privacy officer may be within or external to the agency (i.e. the privacy officer role may be outsourced to a third party) and does not need to be a New Zealand citizen or reside in New Zealand.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The privacy officer's responsibilities include the following:

The encouragement of compliance with the personal information privacy principles contained in the Act
Dealing with requests made to the agency pursuant to the Act
Working with the Privacy Commissioner in relation to investigations relating to the agency
Ensuring compliance with the provisions of the Act
