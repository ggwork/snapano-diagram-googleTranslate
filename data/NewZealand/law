The Privacy Act 2020 (Act) and its Information Privacy Principles (IPPs) govern how agencies collect, use, disclose, store, retain and give access to personal information. The Act gives the Privacy Commissioner the power to issue codes of practice that modify the operation of the Act in relation to specific industries, agencies, activities or types of personal information. The following codes are currently in place:

Credit Reporting Privacy Code


Health Information Privacy Code


Justice Sector Unique Identifier Code


Superannuation Schemes Unique Identifier Code


Telecommunications Information Privacy Code


Civil Defence National Emergencies (Information Sharing) Code

Enforcement is through the Privacy Commissioner. The Privacy Commissioner has the power to investigate any action which appears to interfere with the privacy of an individual and can do so either on a complaint made to the Commissioner or on the Commissioner's own initiative.&nbsp;The Privacy Commissioner can also issue compliance notices requiring agencies to do or refrain from doing something in order to comply with the Act.
Under the Act, an agency can be any person or body of persons, whether corporate or unincorporated, and whether in the public sector or in the private sector.
The Act has an extraterritorial scope â€“ it applies to any actions taken by an overseas organisation in the course of carrying on business in New Zealand, regardless of where the information is or was collected or held and where the person to whom the information relates is located. An organisation would be treated as carrying on business in New Zealand whether or not it has a physical place of business in New Zealand, charges any monetary payment for goods or services, or makes a profit from its business in New Zealand.Last modified 20 Dec 2021
