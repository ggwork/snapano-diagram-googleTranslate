Private entities are allowed to create and maintain databases for purposes of sending marketing and promotional emails, provided that the requirements mentioned in the 'Collection and Processing' section have been fulfilled.
However, any person may require that his/her information be deleted for such purposes, either permanently or temporarily.
The Chilean Consumer Protection Act (Law 19,496/1997 on the protection of consumer rights) defines 'advertising' as the communication that the provider of goods or services send to the public by any means, in order to inform and motivate the purchase goods or services. It also indicates that all promotional or advertising communication must indicate an expeditious way in which the recipients can request the suspension of the promotional communication (opt-out). After a consumer has exercised his opt out right, the sending of new communications is prohibited. In case of promotional or advertising communication sent by e-mail, the communication must also indicate the subject matter or theme and the identity of the sender.Last modified 24 Jan 2022
