Since there is no special data protection authority in Chile, data protection violations must be challenged with a Constitutional Protective Action obased on an alleged violation of the constitutionally guaranteed right to protection of personal data, or with an action before the ordinary civil courts. In addition, the PDPL provides for a special type of action in the event that a controller fails to respond in a timely manner to a request to assert data subject rights ('Habeas Data').
With the entry into force of the Pro-Consumer Law (see in the section on Authority), and the competency thereby granted to the consumer protection agency SERNAC, consumers can lodge complaints alleging the violation of the data protection law to this authority. The SERNAC cannot impose fines, but may initiate and participate in judicial proceedings and collective voluntary proceedings.Last modified 24 Jan 2022
