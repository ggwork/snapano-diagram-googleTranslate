The PDPL does not establish specific measures that need to be adopted for the security of the personal data processed. It only stipulates that the controller is required to take care of the data with due diligence, being liable in case of damages.
All individuals involved in the processing of personal data (other than from publicly accessible sources) have to comply with confidentiality obligations, even after they end their work in this field. Last modified 24 Jan 2022
