The data controller may only transfer personal data to a foreign State with the authorisation of the national authority in accordance with Law No. 18-07 and if that State ensures an adequate level of protection of the privacy and fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals with regard to the processing of such data.&nbsp;
In any case, it is forbidden to communicate or transfer personal data to a foreign country, when such transfer is likely to affect public security or the vital interests of the State.&nbsp;
However, as the national authority has not yet been established, the consent of the data subject is required.Last modified 22 Dec 2021
