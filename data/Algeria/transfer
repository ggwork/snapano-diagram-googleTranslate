The data controller may only transfer personal data to a foreign State with the authorisation of the national authority in accordance with Law No. 18-07 and if that State ensures an adequate level of protection of the privacy and fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals with regard to the processing of such data.
In any case, it is forbidden to communicate or transfer personal data to a foreign country, when such transfer is likely to affect public security or the vital interests of the State.&nbsp;
However, as the national authority has not yet been established, the consent of the data subject is required.Last modified 22 Dec 2021
