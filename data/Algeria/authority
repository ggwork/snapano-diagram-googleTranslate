An independent administrative authority for the protection of personal data, known as the "national authority", is hereby established, with its headquarters in Algiers.&nbsp;
The national authority is responsible for ensuring that the processing of personal data is carried out in accordance with the provisions of the law and for ensuring that the use of information and communication technologies does not pose a threat to the rights of individuals, public freedoms and privacy.&nbsp;
However, although Law No. 18-07 provides for the existence of a national authority, it has not yet been set up.Last modified 22 Dec 2021
