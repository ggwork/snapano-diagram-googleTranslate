These measures must ensure a level of security appropriate to the risks presented by the processing and the nature of the data to be protected.&nbsp;
If the processing is carried out on behalf of the controller, the controller must choose a processor providing sufficient guarantees in respect of the technical and organisational security measures relating to the processing to be carried out and must ensure compliance with those measures.&nbsp;&nbsp;
