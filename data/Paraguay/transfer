The Personal Credit Data Protection Law establishes that international transfers of personal data to a recipient that is in a third country (as defined under the Law), &nbsp;or to an international organization where the guarantees, requirements and/or exceptions established in the Law are not met, is a violation of applicable data protection law and, thus, can be subject to sanctions (Art. 21.x. of the Law).
Under current legislation, there are no other specific provisions that regulate the transfer of private information. However, the transfer of private information is considered as a form of data processing, so the same rules than for collection and processing personal data applies (Art. 3.e. of the Law â€“ definition treatment of data).Last modified 24 Jan 2022
