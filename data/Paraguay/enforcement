The current legal regime contemplates the following enforcement mechanisms:

Without the need of a court order, a data subject has the right to (i) access the information and data about themselves, their dependents and/or property and know how such data is used; and (ii) request the correction and suppression of the information Art. 5 and 8 of Personal Credit Data Protection Law). Data controllers and processors must establish simple, fast, accessible and free of charge procedures, to enable data subjects to exercise their rights. However, where the data subjectâ€™s efforts in obtaining the above are unsuccessful, it may bring court actions to compel access to personal data and request the correction, suppression or updating of such data; and
Violations against obligations established under the Personal Credit Data Protection Law and the Electronic Commerce Law are subject to fines.

The enforcement authorities for the enforcement of the Personal Credit Data Protection Law are the Central Bank of Paraguay ('BCP') and the National Secretariat of Consumer and User Defense ('SEDECO'). The BCP has authority to further regulate, interpret and enforce the Law (Art. 20 of Personal Credit Data Protection Law).Last modified 24 Jan 2022
