Definition of personal data&nbsp;
Art. 3 of Personal Credit Data Protection Law defines Personal Data or Personal Information as “information of any type that refers to legal entities or natural persons that are identified or identifiable. An identifiable person shall mean any person who can be identified by means of an identifier or by one or more elements that characterize the physical, physiological, genetics, mental, economic, cultural, or social identity of the data subject. The rights and guarantees of personal data protection shall be extended to legal entities, insofar as they are applicable”.
Definition of sensitive personal data&nbsp;
Sensitive Personal Data is defined as information that refers to the intimate sphere of the data subject, or data that, if misused, may give rise to discrimination or entail a serious risk for the data subject. Personal data is considered sensitive when it reveals aspects such as racial and ethnic origin; religious, philosophical and moral beliefs or convictions; trade union memberships; political opinion; data related to health, life, sexual preference or orientation, genetic or biometric data aimed at uniquely identifying a natural person.
Personal Credit Data Protection Law further defines Credit Data as 'information, positive and negative, related to the credit history of natural persons and legal entities, in relation to credit, commercial and other activities of similar nature, that serves to identify, correctly and unequivocally, the data subject, his/her address, business activity, determine his/her level of indebtedness, compliance with his/her financial obligations and, in general, of his/her credit risks, at any given time'.Last modified 24 Jan 2022
