There are no EU-wide systems of registration or notification and Recital 89 of the GDPR seeks to prohibit indiscriminate general notification obligations. However, Member States may impose notification obligations for specific activities (eg, processing of personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences). The requirement to consult the supervisory authority in certain cases following a data protection impact assessment (Article 36) constitutes a notification requirement. In addition, each controller or processor must communicate the details of its data protection officer (where it is required to appoint one) to its supervisory authority (Article 37(7)).
In many ways, external accountability to supervisory authorities via registration or notification is superseded in the GDPR by rigorous demands for internal accountability. In particular, controllers and processors are required to complete and maintain comprehensive records of their data processing activities (Article 30), which must contain specific details about personal data processing carried out within an organization and must be provided to supervisory authorities on request. This is a sizeable operational undertaking.According to Article 31 of the DPA, controllers need to consult with and obtain prior authorization from the supervisory authority in relation to processing by a controller for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest, including processing in relation to social protection and public health. The GDPR generally implies certain withdrawal from the previous policy that processing of personal data may be based on licenses, but this Article in the DPA is an exception.
Article 30 of the DPA implements the requirement to consult the supervisory authority in certain cases following a data protection impact assessment. Furthermore advertisement no. 828/2019 lists the processing activities that require a data protection impact assessment.
