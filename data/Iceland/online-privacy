There are no provisions in Icelandic legislation that specifically deal with the use of cookies or location data. However, location data and IP addresses are considered personal data under the Data Protection Act.
If the use of cookies leads to the use of IP addresses or other personal data, the processing of such data must comply with the Data Protection Act. The processing is therefore not permissible unless one of the listed conditions is met, in most instances the data subject must consent to the processing of such data. &nbsp;Last modified 22 Jan 2021
