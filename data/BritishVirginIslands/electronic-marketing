The DPA applies to “direct marketing”, which is the communication, by whatever means, of any advertising or marketing material that is directed to particular individuals and therefore includes electronic marketing.
Prior express consent is not required for the purposes of direct marketing. However, a data subject has an unconditional right to require the date controller to stop, or not to commence, the processing of any of their personal data for the purposes of direct marketing (i.e., an “opt-out” right).Last modified 24 Jan 2022
