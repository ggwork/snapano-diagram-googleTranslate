The DPA does not require data controllers to notify the Information Commissioner or the data subjects of personal data breaches.
However, notice requirements apply to data controllers that receive enforcement notices from the Information Commissioner. The DPA requires a public or private body to, as soon as practicable, and in any event within 30 days of complying with an enforcement notice from the Information Commissioner: (i) notify the data subject(s) concerned; and (ii) any person to whom the personal data was disclosed within the twelve months preceding the date of service of the enforcement notice (as determined by the Information Commissioner).Last modified 24 Jan 2022
