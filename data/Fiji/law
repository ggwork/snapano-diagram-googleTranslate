There is no specific legislation for personal data protection in Fiji. Clause 24 of the Constitution (2013) provides the right to personal privacy, includes right to confidentiality of personal information.&nbsp;
Some sector-specific laws criminalise (or expose to other serious action) the unauthorised disclosure by others of personal/client information as follows:

Banking Act 1995 – by central bank personnel (s.27) and licensed financial institution personnel (s.71)
Fiji Revenue and Customs Service Act 1998 – by tax officials (s.52 (2))
Medical and Dental Practitioner Act 2010 – by statutory administrators of any data obtained in the course of their duties (s.126)
Under the Rules of Professional Conduct and Practice (para 1.4) of the Legal Practitioners Act 2009 - information received by legal practitioners from or on behalf of clients
Cybercrime Act 2021 (has not commenced yet) - Defines ‘computer data’ which is broad enough to capture personal data if it stored in a computer system.&nbsp;

These laws, however, do not directly protect personal information.Last modified 10 Jan 2022
