The PDPL does not expressly regulate electronic marketing. However, the PDPL does apply to electronic marketing activities if personal data is processed as a result.
If consent is obtained through electronic media, the notice requirements can be met by&nbsp;publishing accessible and identifiable privacy policies with the relevant consent language and mechanism. The PDPL establishes the possibility of obtaining express consent by presenting the option to agree with the privacy policies in clickable ways (eg, by clicking, ticking a box).
Written consent may be provided by other options, including:

Through an electronic signature
A written document possible to read or print
A mechanism or procedure that allows one to identify the subject and to receive his consent through a written text
A pre-established text as long as it is easily visible, legible and written in simple language

The laws governing electronic signatures are:

Law N째 27291
The Digital Certificates and Signatures Law (Law N째 27269)
Supreme Decree N째 052-2008-PCM

Note that expressing the will in any of the&nbsp;regulated forms does not eliminate the other&nbsp;requirements of consent referring to that consent must be informed, and freely given.
According to the Consumer Protection Code Law N째 29571, the following commercial activities require prior, informed, express and unequivocal consent to promote products and services:

Use of call centers
Use of telephone call systems
Bulk text messages or emails
Telemarketing services

It is permitted to obtain personal information from public sources or by licit means in order to contact the data subjects to gettheir consent for the aforementioned commercial activities. Notwithstanding the foregoing, whenever the data subject does not grant its consent for commercial activities, it must not be contacted again for those purposes.
Furthermore, easily accessible and free mechanisms must be implemented to allow the data subjects to revoke their consent for the commercial purposes.Last modified 24 Jan 2022
