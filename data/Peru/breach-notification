The holder of a database (and processor, where applicable) is required to implement security measures to prevent the unauthorized access to personal data.
As a consequence, an implied obligation would be to adopt all corrective measures in the event of a data breach to minimize the damages it may cause to the data subjects. For that reasons, the Security Directive establishes security measures against:

The loss of the personal database, and
An unauthorized processing of the personal database

In this way, any case of data breach should be communicated to the data subjects as soon as it is confirmed. The database owner must inform the data subject of 'any incident that&nbsp;significantly affects their property or their moral rights', as soon as the occurrence of the incident is confirmed.
The minimum information to be provided in a notice includes a description of:

The incident
Personal data disclosed
Recommendations to the data subject
Corrective measures implemented

Mandatory breach notification
No breach notification to the NDPA is required.Last modified 24 Jan 2022
