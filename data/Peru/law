Article 2 of the Political Constitution of Peru sets forth certain fundamental rights that every person has, including a right to privacy regarding information that affects personal and family privacy, which was the basis for the creation of a law that specifically protects the use of personal data of any natural person and applies to both private and state entities.
The Personal Data Protection Law N° 29733 (PDPL) was enacted in June 2011. In March 2013, the Supreme Decree N° 003-2013-JUS-Regulation of the PDLP (Regulation) was published in order to develop, clarify and expand on the requirements of the PDPL and set forth specific rules, terms and provisions regarding data protection.
Together, the PDLP and its Regulation are the primary data protection laws in Peru.
Further, the law regulating private risk centers and the protection of the owner of the information is Law Nº 27489, enacted in 2001 and later amended several times. This law establishes the applicable provisions for activities related to risk centers and companies that handle:

Information posing higher risks to individuals (eg, related to financial, commercial, tax,&nbsp;employment or insurance obligations or background of a natural or legal person that allows evaluating its economic solvency), and
Sensitive personal data (according to the PDPL)
