The DP Act distinguishes between the transfer of personal information to a recipient in a Member State of the South African Development Community (SADC) that has transposed the SADC data protection requirements and the transfer of personal information to a Member state that has not transposed the SADC data protection requirements or to a non-Member State.
Personal information shall only be transferred to recipients in a Member State that has transposed the SADC data protection requirements:

Where the recipient establishes that the data is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or pursuant to the lawful functions of a data controller, or


Where the recipient establishes the necessity of having the data transferred and there is no reason to assume that the data subject's legitimate interests might be prejudiced by the transfer or the processing in the Member State

Further to the above, the DP Act requires that the controller make a provisional evaluation of the necessity for the transfer of the data. The recipient shall ensure that the necessity for the transfer of the data can be subsequently verified. The data controller shall ensure that the recipient shall process the personal information only for the purposes for which they were transferred.
Personal information may only be transferred to recipients, not SADC Member States subject to national law adopted pursuant to the SADC data protection requirements, if an adequate level of protection is ensured in the country of the recipient and the data is transferred solely to permit processing otherwise authorized to be undertaken by the controller.
The adequacy of the level of protection afforded by the relevant third country in question shall be assessed in the light of all the circumstances surrounding the relevant data transfer(s), particular consideration shall be given to the nature of the data, the purpose and duration of the proposed processing, the recipient’s country, the relevant laws in force in the third country and the professional rules and security measures which are complied with in that recipient’s country.Last modified 20 Dec 2021
