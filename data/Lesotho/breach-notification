Where there are reasonable grounds to believe that the personal information of a data subject has been accessed or acquired by an authorized person, the data controller, or any other third party processing personal information under the authority of a data controller, shall notify:

The Commission, and


The data subject, unless the identity of such data subject cannot be established

The notification shall be made as soon as reasonably possible after the discovery of the compromise, taking into account the legitimate needs of law enforcement or any measures reasonably necessary to determine the scope of the compromise and to restore the integrity of the data controller’s information system.
The data controller, in terms of section 23(3), shall delay notification to the data subject where the Lesotho Mounted Police Service, the National Security Service or the Commission determines that notification will impede a criminal investigation.
The breach notification to a data subject shall be in writing and communicated to the data subject in one of the following ways:

Mailed to the data subject’s last known physical or postal address


Sent by email to the data subject’s last known email address


Placed in a prominent position on the website of the party responsible for notification


Published in the news media


As may be directed by the commission

The notification is required to provide sufficient information to allow the data subject to take protective measures against potential consequences of the compromise, including, if known to the data controller, the identity of the unauthorized person who may have accessed or acquired the personal information.
