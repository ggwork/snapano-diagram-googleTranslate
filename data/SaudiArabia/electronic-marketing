There are specific rules around the use of Personal Data for marketing purposes in the PDPL. This includes that Data Controllers must not use personal means of communications, including postal and electronic addresses, of the Data Subject in order to send promotional or awareness materials without first obtaining the consent of the Data Subject, and providing the Data Subject with a mechanism to opt-out.
Additional requirements may also apply in specific contexts â€“ for example, in the context of e-commerce activity.Last modified 17 Jan 2022
