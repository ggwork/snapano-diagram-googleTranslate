The PDPIR does not contain any express enforcement mechanism or penalties for non-compliance.
As per the PDPL, there are criminal penalties and fines for the following offences:

unlawfully transferring data out of KSA (imprisonment of up to 1 year and/or a fine of up to SAR 1 million); and
disclosing or publishing Sensitive Data unlawfully with intent of harming the Data Subject or with the intention of achieving some personal benefit (imprisonment up to 2 years and/or a fine of up to SAR 3 million).

Separately, SDAIA has the power to issue warnings / administrative fines of up to SAR 5 million for any other violation, which is appealable. This is without prejudice to any more severe penalty stipulated in another law.&nbsp;
Note, the competent court may double the penalty of a fine for repeat offenders.Last modified 17 Jan 2022
