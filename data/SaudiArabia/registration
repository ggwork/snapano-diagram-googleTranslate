The PDPIR does not impose registration requirements.
As per the PDPL, Data Controllers must register with SDAIA. There will be a fixed fee for private entities that are Data Controllers, which is yet to be published in the Executive Regulations of the PDPL.
In addition, under the PDPL, records of processing activities ("ROPA") need to be registered with SDAIA. Like other data protection laws, the PDPL appears to require that the Data Controller prepares a ROPA. However, unlike other data protection laws, the PDPL indicates that the ROPA must also recorded with SDAIA.Last modified 17 Jan 2022
