Under the PDPIR, Data Controllers must notify the Regulatory Authorities immediately, and no later than 72 hours, in the event of any data breach or leakage impacting Personal Data in accordance with the mechanisms and procedures determined by the Regulatory Authorities. In the event Data Controllers are not subject to specific Regulatory Authorities, then the NDMO will exercise the roles and functions of such authorities. &nbsp;
Under the PDPL, Data Controllers must notify the competent authority (as per the PDPL, this is to be determined by a decision of the Cabinet) as soon as it becomes aware of the occurrence of a leakage or damage of Personal Data, including if Personal Data was illegally accessed. In addition, the Executive Regulations will specify circumstances in which the Data Controller must notify the Data Subject in the event of a leakage or damage of the Data Subject's Personal Data or illegal access thereto. However, if the occurrence of any of the above would cause serious harm to the Data Subject's data or the Data Subject, the Data Controller must notify the Data Subject immediately.
In addition, notification obligations may be triggered in specific contexts / sectors â€“ for example, cloud service providers may be required to report security breaches to the CITC depending upon the circumstances.Last modified 17 Jan 2022
