The data protection landscape in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia ("KSA") is primarily (but not exclusively) regulated by the following:

Personal Data Protection Law ("PDPL") when it comes into effect in March 2022; and
Personal Data Protection Interim Regulations ("PDPIR") issued by the National Data Management Office ("NDMO").

The PDPL was published in the KSA Official Gazette on 24 September 2021. It becomes fully effective on 23 March 2022. &nbsp;Data Controllers (as defined in the PDPL) then have another year in which to comply with the PDPL, although this period might be extended. The PDPL will be supplemented by Executive Regulations, which should be published by 23 March 2022, and which will provide further guidance on the application of the PDPL.
While the PDPL is not effective as law until 23 March 2022, the PDPIR is, as we understand it, in effect now.
Both the PDPIR and the PDPL have extra-territorial effect. In particular (subject to limited exceptions):

The PDPIR applies to all entities in KSA that process Personal Data in whole or in part, as well as entities outside of KSA that process Personal Data related to individuals residing in KSA using any means, including online Personal Data processing;
The PDPL applies to any processing of Personal Data related to individuals that takes place in KSA by any means, including the processing of Personal Data related to individuals residing in KSA by any means by any entity outside of KSA.

There may also be specific regulations applicable to certain industries / sectors, for example, in banking, which is regulated by the Saudi Central Bank (previously known as the Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority).Last modified 17 Jan 2022
