Under the PDPIR, Data Controllers may only store and process Personal Data outside KSA after obtaining written approval from the relevant "Regulatory Authority" and the Regulatory Authority must coordinate with the NDMO.
"Regulatory Authority" is defined as "Any independent governmental or public entity assuming regulatory duties and responsibilities for a specific sector in KSA under a legal instrument.“
In the event Data Controllers are not subject to specific Regulatory Authorities, then the NDMO will exercise the roles and functions of such authorities. &nbsp;
Data Controllers must also obtain NDMO’s approval, having coordinated with the Regulatory Authority, prior to sharing Personal Data with other entities outside of KSA.
Under the PDPL, data transfers out of KSA are even more tightly controlled than under the PDPIR. Personal Data transfers outside of KSA are prohibited except in the following circumstances:

extreme necessity to preserve the life of a Data Subject outside of KSA or the Data Subject’s "vital interests";
to prevent, examine or treat a disease;
if the transfer is in implementation of an obligation under which the KSA is a party;
to serve the interests of KSA; or
other purposes as determined by the Executive Regulations (yet to be issued).

However, the above is still predicated upon complying with the following conditions:

the transfer or disclosure does not prejudice national security or the vital interests of KSA;
there are sufficient guarantees for preserving the confidentiality of the Personal Data to be transferred or disclosed, so that the standards are not less than the standards in the PDPL and the Executive Regulations;
the transfer or disclosure must be limited to the minimum Personal Data needed; and
the competent authority approves the transfer or disclosure, as determined by the Executive Regulations.

However, the competent authority may exempt the Data Controller, on a case-by-case basis, from being bound by these conditions if:

the transfer does not prejudice national security or the vital interests of KSA;
if the competent authority, jointly or severally with other parties, sees that the Personal Data will have an acceptable level of protection outside of KSA; and
the Personal Data is not Sensitive Data.

Note also that the relevant definitions for "processing" under both the PDPIR and PDPL include, amongst other things, transfer of Personal Data, and so the consent requirements relating to processing are also relevant / applicable.
In addition, in certain contexts or sectors, specific approvals may be required - for example, in a banking context, approval from the Saudi Central Bank.Last modified 17 Jan 2022
