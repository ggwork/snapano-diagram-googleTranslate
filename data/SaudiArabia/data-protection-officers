There is no specific requirement under the PDPIR for organisations to appoint a data protection officer.
As per the PDPL, foreign Data Controllers must appoint a representative in KSA to be licensed by the "competent authority" (as per the PDPL, this is to be determined by a decision of the Cabinet)&nbsp; to perform the Data Controller’s obligations stipulated under the provisions of the PDPL and the Executive Regulations (once issued).
This appointment does not prejudice the responsibilities of this foreign Data Controller towards the Data Subject or SDAIA. The Executive Regulations are to set out the provisions related to licensing and the limits of the representative’s relationship with the Data Controller outside KSA, which he represents.Last modified 17 Jan 2022
