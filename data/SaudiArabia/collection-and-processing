As per the PDPIR, Personal Data may not be collected or processed without the Data Subjectâ€™s express consent.&nbsp; "Consent" is defined as "a knowing, voluntary, clear, and specific, expression of consent, whether oral or written, from the Data Subject signifying agreement to the processing of personal data."
As per the PDPL, the primary basis for processing is consent of the Data Subject. The Executive Regulations will outline the "cases in which the consent must be in writing". This indicates that there may be cases in which consent can be collected by means other than in writing. However the PDPL itself does not refer to a concept of processing for "legitimate interests" in the same manner as the GDPR, and indeed as other data protection frameworks in the region allow for.
Rather, the PDPL allows for processing other than on the basis of consent if:

the processing achieves a "definite interest" (not defined) of the Data Subject and it is impossible or difficult to contact the Data Subject;
if the processing is in accordance with another law, or in the implementation of an earlier agreement to which the Data Subject is a party; and
if the Data Controller is a public entity and such processing is required for security purposes or to meet judicial requirements.
