Personal Data Protection Law (hereinafter 'PDPL') identifies personal data as any information about the facts, events and circumstances of the life of a data subject, which allow to identify him/her.
Under the foregoing law the data subject is considered a physical person, to whom relevant personal data refers.
PDPL does not define the term of sensitive data. However it provides the definition of biometric personal data which includes biometrical and physiological data which identifies the data subject. Biometric personal data may be collected upon receipt of the subjectâ€™s consent.Last modified 14 Jan 2020
