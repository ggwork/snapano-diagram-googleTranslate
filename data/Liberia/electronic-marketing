Section 13.46(1) of the Liberia Electronics Transaction Law (2002) states that: “a person who has access to any record, book, register, correspondence, information, document or other material in the course of performing a function under or for the purposes of this Law shall not disclose or permit or suffer to be disclosed such record, book, register, correspondence, information, document or other material to any other person”. However, Section 13.46(2) of the Act provides that the above-quoted provision of Sub-section 1 does not apply to disclosure:&nbsp;

Which is necessary for performing or assisting in the performance of a function under or for the purposes of this Law;
For the purpose of any criminal proceedings in Liberia or elsewhere;
For the purpose of complying with a requirement made under a rule of law with a view to instituting a criminal proceeding in Liberia or elsewhere; or
Under the direction or order of a court.
