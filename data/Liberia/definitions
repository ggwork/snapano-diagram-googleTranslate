Definition of Personal Data
Personal Data is not defined by existing laws. Data is however, defined variously by different statutes and legal instrument in Liberia as follows:&nbsp;

Financial Intelligence Unit Act of 2012: “Data" means: representations, in any form, of information or concepts”.
Central Bank of Liberia (“CBL”) E-Payment Regulation: “Data integrity” means “the assurance that information that is in-transit or in storage is not altered without authorization”
The ECOWAS Supplemental Act of which, Liberia is a signing member defines personal data as “any information relating to an identified individual or who may be directly identifiable by reference to an identification number or one or several elements related to their physical, physiological, genetic, psychological, cultural, social, or economic identity”. Accordingly, it can be concluded that that (i) cards numbers and (ii) account numbers from which a person can be directly identified qualify as sensitive personal information/data.
