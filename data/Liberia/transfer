The CBL Act restricts the unauthorized transfer of customer’s information. Section 3.3 of the Central Bank of Liberia (“CBL”) Regulation Concerning Consumer Protection and Market Conduct provides that: “a relevant financial institution shall exercise the maximum protection of consumer’s information and shall not disclose any information about a consumer to a third party except where (i) the institution is required by law to disclosed such information, or (ii) the disclosure is made with the expressed consent of the consumer”.&nbsp;It also provides that “each relevant financial institution shall have in place information security guidelines or policies, a secured database, and procedures for handling of customers’ information. The guidelines or policies shall cover the information technology (IT) risk management system with respect to customer’s information protection.” Last modified 21 Feb 2022
