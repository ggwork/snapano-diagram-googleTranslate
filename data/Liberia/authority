No specific national data protection agency or authority exists in Liberia, and besides a broad statement in the Liberian Constitution that “no person shall be subjected to interference with his privacy of person, family, home or correspondence except by order of a court of competent jurisdiction”, there is no dedicated privacy law whether of person or in respect of data, not to mention any dedicated data protection authority.&nbsp;
Admittedly, Liberia is a signatory to The ECOWAS Supplemental Act of which, requires member States, including Liberia, to establish National Data Authority within their jurisdiction. However, Liberia has not yet established such authority.&nbsp;&nbsp;Last modified 21 Feb 2022
