There is generally no breach notification requirement, nor any dedicated agency or entity to which such notification must be made.
Mandatory breach notification
Whenever a private action is contemplated through the courts, it is mandatory that the accused is apprised of the matter in order to inform the prospective defendant of the allegation against him or her. This is usually accomplished through the issuance of the appropriate Writ issued by the court which is served upon the Defendant.Last modified 21 Feb 2022
