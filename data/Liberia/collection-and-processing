As used in the National Information and Communications Technology Policy of 2019, the term “data collector” refers to any entity, institution or person&nbsp;– governmental or private&nbsp;– that gathers information of an individual/a consumer for the use and identification of the individual/consumer in its business/line of work.&nbsp;
In respect of the processing of data, the Central Bank of Liberia “E-Payment Regulation” states in 19.1 that “All e-payment service providers shall maintain privacy and confidentiality of customer information and data, unless sharing customer information and data is authorized by the customer or on a court order or in keeping with the AML/CFT Regulations for Financial Institutions in Liberia.”&nbsp;
Section 19.2 provides that the conditions under which customer information and data will be kept shall be disclosed before the customer enters into agreement with the Authorized Institution while Section 19.3 states that “Provisions of data protection including confidentiality shall be in tandem with all relevant laws”.Last modified 21 Feb 2022
