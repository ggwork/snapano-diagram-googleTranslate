The dissemination of electronic communications for advertising purposes is generally subject to the prior express consent of its recipient (opt-in) and to prior notification to APD.
Entities may process personal data for electronic marketing purposes without data subject consent in specific circumstances, notably:

When advertising is addressed to the data subject as representative employee of a corporate person, and
When advertising communications are sent to an individual with whom the product or service supplier has already concluded a transaction, provided an opportunity to refuse consent was expressly provided to the customer at the time of the transaction at no additional cost.
