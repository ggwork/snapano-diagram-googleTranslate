International transfers of personal data to countries with an adequate level of protection require prior notification to the APD. An adequate level of protection is understood as a level of protection equal to the Angolan Data Protection Law. APD decides which countries ensure an adequate level of protection by issuing an opinion to this respect.
International transfers of personal data to countries that do not ensure an adequate level of protection are subject to prior authorization from the APD, which will only be granted if specific requirements are met. For transfers between companies in the same group, the requirement of an adequate level of protection may be reached through the adoption of harmonized and mandatory internal rules on data protection and privacy.
Please note that the communication of personal data to a recipient, a third party or a subcontracted entity is subject to specific legal conditions and requirements.Last modified 30 Dec 2021
