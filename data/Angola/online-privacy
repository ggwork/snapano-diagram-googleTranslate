The Electronic Communications and Information Society Services Law establishes the right of all Citizens to enjoy protection against abuse or violations of their rights through the Internet or other electronics means, such as:

The right to confidentiality of communications and to privacy and non-disclosure of their data
The right to security of their information by improvement of quality, reliability and integrity of the information systems
The right to security on the Internet, specifically for minors
The right not to receive spam
The right to the protection and safeguarding of their consumer rights and as users of networks or electronic communications services

In view of the above, entities are generally prohibited from storing any kind of personal data without prior consent of the user. This does not prevent technical storage or access for the sole purpose of carrying out the transmission of a communication over an e-communication network or if strictly necessary in order for the provider of an information society service to provide a service expressly requested by the subscriber or user.
Traffic data
The processing of traffic data is allowed when required for billing and payment purposes, but processing is only permitted until the end of the period during which the bill may lawfully be challenged or payment pursued. Traffic data must be eliminated or made anonymous when no longer needed for the transmission of the communication.
The storage of specific information and access to that information is only allowed on the condition that the subscriber or user has provided his or her prior consent. The consent must be based on accurate, clear and comprehensive information, namely about the type of data processed, the purposes and duration of the processing and the availability of data to third parties in order to provide value added services.
Electronic communications operators may store traffic data only to the extent required and for the time necessary to market electronic communications services or provide value added services. Prior express consent is required and such consent may be withdrawn at any time.
Processing should be limited to those employees in charge of:

Billing or traffic management
Customer inquiries
Fraud detection
Marketing of electronic communications
Services accessible to the public
The provision of value added services

Notwithstanding the above, electronic communication operators should keep in an autonomous file all traffic and localization data exclusively for the purpose of:

Investigation
Detection, or
Prosecution of criminal offenses on Information and Communication Technologies (ICT)

Location data
Location Data processing is only allowed if the data is made anonymous or to the extent and for the duration necessary for the provision of value added services, provided prior express consent is obtained. In this case, prior complete and accurate information must be provided on the type of data being processed, as well as the purposes and duration of processing and any possibility of disclosure to third parties for the provision of value added services.
Electronic communication operators must ensure that data subjects have the opportunity to withdraw consent, or temporarily refuse the processing of such data for each connection to the network or for each transmission of a communication, at any time. The withdrawal mechanism must be provided through simple means, free of charge to the user. Processing should be limited to those employees in charge of electronic communications services accessible to the public.Last modified 30 Dec 2021
