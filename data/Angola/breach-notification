There is no mandatory breach notification requirement under the Data Protection Law.
However, pursuant to the Electronic Communications and Information Society Services Law, companies offering electronic communications services accessible to the public shall, without undue delay, notify the APD and the Electronic Communications Authority, Instituto Angolano das Comunicações, (INACOM) of any breach of security committed with intent or that recklessly leads to destruction, loss, partial or total modification or non-authorized access to personal data transmitted, stored, retained or in any way processed under the offer of electronic communications services.
Companies offering electronic communications services accessible to the public shall also keep an accurate register of data breaches, indicating the concrete facts and consequences of each breach and the measures put in place to repair or prevent the breach.
The same applies under Protection of Information Systems and Networks Law.Last modified 30 Dec 2021
