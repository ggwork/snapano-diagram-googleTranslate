No geographic transfer restrictions apply in Burundi. Certain sector specific provisions require companies to obtain consent prior to third party transfers of personal information. Notably, under Article 16 of Law n Â° 1/012 of May 30, 2018 on the Code of Health Care and Health Services Provision in Burundi, "every patient has the right to decide on the use of the medical information concerning him and the conditions under which they may be transmitted to third parties."Last modified 28 Jan 2019
