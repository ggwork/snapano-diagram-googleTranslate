If a data collector wishes to use a data subject’s personal data for the purpose of direct marketing whether electronic or otherwise, such data collector is required to give the data subject a privacy notice (see Collection and Processing).
If a data subject requests the data controller to cease direct marketing, the data collector must stop using the data subject’s personal data for marketing.
In this regard, when a data collector uses personal data of a data subject to conduct marketing for the first time, the data collector must advise the data subject that they have the right to require cessation of the marketing and provide the data subject with information as to how to exercise such right. Also, the data collector must bear the cost of the first cessation request (e.g. by providing a toll-free line to call or a stamped pre-addressed envelope for return mail).Last modified 10 Dec 2021
