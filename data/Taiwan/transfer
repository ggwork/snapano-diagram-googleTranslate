The privacy notice to data subjects must set out the extent to which personal data will be transferred to others.&nbsp;
Cross-border transmissions of personal data are regulated by the PDPA. The Taiwan authorities may restrict the cross-border transmission and use of personal data in the following circumstances:

when a substantial interest of Taiwan is at stake;
as provided under an international treaty or agreement (as at December 10, 2021, there are no such treaties or agreements in place);
when the receiving country lacks proper laws or regulations adequately to protect personal data or where infringement of the rights and interests of the data subject is threatened; or
the purpose of the transfer is to evade the application of the PDPA.

The Taiwan National Communications Commission (NCC) issued an order in 2012 prohibiting communications enterprises from transferring subscribersâ€™ personal data to mainland China on the grounds that the personal data protection laws in mainland China were still inadequate. As at December 10, 2021, there are no other restrictions or prohibitions on the cross-border transfers to any country/area.Last modified 10 Dec 2021
