Under the PDPA, in order to collect, process and use personal data, the data collector is required to give a data subject a privacy notice at the time the data subject’s personal data is first collected. Such privacy notice is required, inter alia, to contain:

the name of the data collector
the purpose of collection
classification of personal data to be collected
time period for the use, geographical area of the use, recipients of the data and the manner of using personal data
the rights of the data subject to request to review his/her personal data, to make copies of such personal data, to supplement or correct such personal data, to discontinue collection, processing or use of personal data or to delete such personal data, together with the manner in which the data subject makes such requests, and
the impact on the data subject’s rights and interests if the data subject chooses not to provide his/her personal data.&nbsp;

As long as the privacy notice is given when first collecting the personal data, and the privacy notice meets the content requirements set out in the PDPA, the privacy notice is by itself considered sufficient (i.e. consent is not required). This is unless sensitive personal data is collected, in which case data subject consent is required.Last modified 10 Dec 2021
