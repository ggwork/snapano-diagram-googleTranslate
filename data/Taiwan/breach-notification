Upon a data breach, the data collector is required to promptly notify the data subject of:

the fact of the infringement
the measures the data collector has taken to respond to such infringement, and
the contact information of the data collector.

The notice may be made orally, by written document, telephone, text message, email, facsimile, electronic record, or in another manner which the data subject can receive such notice. If the cost of notifying each data subject is “too high”, such notice may be made via the Internet or news media.&nbsp;
In addition, the data collector in certain industries (e.g. travel agents, financial institutions) is required to report to their respective industry regulator and, where it is required to do so, the report to the industry regulator needs to include:&nbsp;

the fact that personal data may have been compromised
the measures the data collector has taken to respond to such compromise (including evidence that the data collector has notified the affected individuals)
the investigation by the data collector (or any outside forensic firm) as to how the data breach occurred
the preventive measure(s) the data collector will take to prevent recurrence of data breach in the future, and
any other information that the industry regulator may require on a case-by-case basis.

In September 2021, steps were taken by the Taiwan authorities to expand the material data breach reporting obligations of security service providers, pawnshops and financial institutions by (i) requiring such enterprises to report material data breaches to the relevant industry competent authority within a specified period (e.g. 72 hours) and (ii) requiring such competent authorities to further report such breach to the National Development Council within 72 hours of becoming aware of the breach. Such steps are now being implemented or will shortly become effective.Last modified 10 Dec 2021
