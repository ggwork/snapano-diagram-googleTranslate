A corporate entity possessing, dealing or handling any sensitive personal information in a computer resource which it owns, controls or operates is required to implement and maintain reasonable security practices and procedures to secure the sensitive personal information. The reasonable security practices and procedures may be specified in an agreement between the parties.
Further, the Privacy Rules provide that in the absence of such agreement ‘reasonable security practices and procedures’ to be adopted by any corporate entity to secure sensitive personal information are procedures that comply with the IS/ISO/IEC 27001 standard or with the codes of best practices for data protection as approved by the federal government. Presently, no such codes of best practices have been approved by the federal government.Last modified 30 Nov 2021
