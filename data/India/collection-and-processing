Under the Act, if a corporate entity that possesses, manages or handles any sensitive personal information in a computer resource that it owns, controls or operates, is negligent in implementing and maintaining compliance with the Privacy Rules, and its negligence causes wrongful loss or wrongful gain to any person, the corporate entity shall be liable for damages to the person(s) affected.
The Privacy Rules state that any corporate entity or any person acting on its behalf that collects sensitive personal information must obtain written consent (through letter, email or fax) from the providers of that information. However, the August 2011 Press Note issued by the IT Ministry clarifies that consent may be given by any mode of electronic communication.
The Privacy Rules also mandate that any corporate entity (or any person, who on behalf of such entity) that collects, receives, possess, stores, deals or handles information shall provide a privacy policy that discloses its practices regarding the handling and disclosure of personal information, including sensitive personal information, and ensure that the policy is available for view, including on the website of the corporate entity (or the person acting on its behalf). Specifically, the corporate entity must ensure that the person to whom the information relates is notified of the following at the time of collection of sensitive personal information or other personal information:

The fact that the information is being collected&nbsp;
The purpose for which the information is being collected&nbsp;
The intended recipients of the information&nbsp;
The name and address of the agency that is collecting the information and the agency that will retain the information

Further, sensitive personal information may only be collected for a lawful purpose connected with a function or purpose of the corporate entity and only if such collection is considered necessary for that purpose. The corporate entity must also ensure that it does not retain the sensitive personal information for longer than it is required and should also ensure that the sensitive personal information is being used for the purpose for which it was collected.
A corporate entity or any person acting on its behalf is obligated to enable the providers of information to review the information they had so provided and also to ensure that any personal information or sensitive personal information that is found to be inaccurate or deficient is corrected upon request. Further, the provider of information has to be provided a right to opt out (ie, he/she will be able to withdraw his or her consent) even after consent has been provided. However, the corporate entity will not be held responsible for the authenticity of the personal information or sensitive personal information given by the provider of information to such corporate entity or any other person acting on its behalf.Last modified 30 Nov 2021
