Every corporate entity collecting sensitive personal information must appoint a Grievance Officer to address complaints relating to the processing of such information, and to respond to data subject access and correction requests in an expeditious manner but within one month from the date of receipt of the request or grievance.
There is no specific requirement that the data protection officer must be a citizen of or resident of India, nor are there any specific enforcement actions or penalties associated with not appointing a data protection officer correctly. However, appointment of a data protection officer is part of the statutory due diligence process and it is thus imperative that such an officer should be appointed.Last modified 30 Nov 2021
