Transfers of personal data by a controller or a processor to third countries outside of the EU (and Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland) are only permitted where the conditions laid down in the GDPR are met (Article 44).
The European Commission has the power to make an adequacy decision in respect of a third country, determining that it provides for an adequate level of data protection, and therefore personal data may be freely transferred to that country (Article 45(1)). Currently, the following countries or territories enjoy adequacy decisions: Andorra, Argentina, Canada (with some exceptions), Switzerland, Faroe Islands, Guernsey, Israel, Isle of Man, Jersey, Eastern Republic of Uruguay and New Zealand.
Transfers to third countries are also permitted where appropriate safeguards have been provided by the controller or processor and on condition that enforceable data subject rights and effective legal remedies for the data subject are available. The list of appropriate safeguards includes, among others, binding corporate rules and standard contractual clauses. The GDPR has removed the need which existed in some Member States under the previous law to notify and in some cases seek prior approval of standard contractual clauses from supervisory authorities.
The GDPR also includes a list of context specific derogations, permitting transfers to third countries where:&nbsp;

Explicit informed consent has been obtained
The transfer is necessary for the performance of a contract or the implementation of pre-contractual measures
The transfer is necessary for the conclusion or performance of a contract concluded in the interests of the data subject between the controller and another natural or legal person
The transfer is necessary for important reasons of public interest
The transfer is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims
The transfer is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject where consent cannot be obtained
The transfer is made from a register, which according to EU or Member State law, is intended to provide information to the public, subject to certain conditions

There is also a very limited derogation to transfer where no other mechanism is available and the transfer is necessary for the purposes of compelling legitimate interests of the controller which are not overridden by the interests and rights of the data subject. Notification to the supervisory authority and the data subject is required if relying on this derogation.
Transfers demanded by courts, tribunals or administrative authorities of countries outside the EU (Article 48) are only recognized or enforceable (within the EU) where they are based on an international agreement such as a mutual legal assistance treaty in force between the requesting third country and the EU or Member State (transfers in response to such requests where there is no other legal basis for transfer will infringe the GDPR).
No specific provisions in the applicable local law.Last modified 21 Feb 2022
