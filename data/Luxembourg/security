Security
The GDPR is not prescriptive about specific technical standards or measures. Rather, the GDPR adopts a proportionate, context-specific approach to security. Article 32 states that controllers and processors shall implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk of the processing. In so doing, they must take account of the state of the art, the costs of implementation, and the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing. A 'one size fits all' approach is therefore the antithesis of this requirement.
However, the GDPR does require controllers and processors to consider the following when assessing what might constitute adequate security:

The pseudonymization and encryption of personal data
The ability to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of processing systems and services
The ability to restore the availability and access to personal data in a timely manner in the event of a physical or technical incident
A process for regularly testing, assessing and evaluating the effectiveness of technical and organizational measures for ensuring the security of the processing
Article 65 of the Law of August 1, 2018 on the organization of the National Data Protection Commission provides specific technical measures that must be put in place for limited categories of processing (ie, processing of personal data for scientific or historical research purposes or for statistical purposes, and processing of special categories of personal data for archiving purposes in the public interest).
Such measures include:

Resorting to an independent trusted third party for the anonymization or pseudonymization of the personal data
Log files allowing for the identification of the purpose, date and time of consultation of the personal data as well as for the identification of the person having collected, modified or deleted the personal data
