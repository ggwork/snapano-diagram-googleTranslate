Part VI of the Act
The transfer of personal data outside Kenya is highly regulated under the Act. Prior to any transfer the data controller or data processor must provide proof to the DPC on the appropriate safeguards with respect to the security and protection of the personal data including jurisdictions with similar data protection laws.
The consent of the data subject is required for the transfer of sensitive personal data out of Kenya.
Under the Regulations, civil registration registries cannot transfer personal data collected for civil registration purposes outside Kenya without the written approval of the DPC.
The Data Protection (General) Regulations, 2021 elaborate in more detail transfer of personal data outside Kenya. However, the regulations are yet to be passed into law and are currently awaiting signature by the CS after which they shall be published in the Kenya Gazette. &nbsp;Last modified 9 Dec 2021
