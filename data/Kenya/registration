Section 18 of the Act
Data processors and data controllers are required to be registered with the DPC. The DPC, however, has discretion to prescribe the thresholds for mandatory registration based on:

the nature of industry;
the volumes of data processed; and
whether sensitive personal data is being processed.

The Data Protection (Registration of Data Controllers &amp; Data Processors) Regulations, 2021 provides for the registration of data controllers and data processors with the DPC. The threshold for mandatory registration is also set out under these regulations. However, the regulations are yet to be passed into law and are currently awaiting signature by the CS after which they shall be published in the Kenya Gazette. &nbsp;Last modified 9 Dec 2021
