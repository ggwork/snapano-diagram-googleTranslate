The Data Protection Act, 2019 (the “Act”) came into force on 25th November, 2019 and is now the primary statute on data protection in Kenya. It gives effect to Article 31 c) and d) of the Constitution of Kenya, 2010 (right to privacy).
In October 2020, by virtue of the powers conferred to him under the Act, the Cabinet Secretary for Information, Communication, Technology, Innovation and Youth Affairs gazetted the Data Protection (Civil Registration) Regulations, 2020 (the “Regulations”). The Regulations apply to civil registries involved in processing personal data for registrations such as births, deaths, adoptions, persons, passports and marriages.
Since the Data Protection Commissioner’s (DPC) appointment on 16 November 2020, significant efforts have been made in developing regulations for the implementation of the Act.

Data Protection (Compliance &amp; Enforcement) Regulation, 2021 – sets out the complaints handling procedures and enforcement mechanisms in the event of non-compliance with the provisions of the Act;
Data Protection (Registration of Data Controllers &amp; Data Processors) Regulations, 2021 – provides for the registration of data controllers and data processors with the DPC. The threshold for mandatory registration is also set out under these regulations;&nbsp;and
Data Protection (General) Regulations, 2021 – elaborates in more detail the rights of data subjects, restrictions on commercial use of personal data, duties and obligations of data controllers and data processors, elements of implementing data protection by design or default, notification of personal data breaches, transfer of personal data outside Kenya, conduct of data protection impact assessment and other general provisions.

The above regulations are, however, yet to be passed into law and are currently awaiting signature by the CS after which they shall be published in the Kenya Gazette. &nbsp;Once passed into law, it is expected that the Act shall become fully operational.Last modified 9 Dec 2021
