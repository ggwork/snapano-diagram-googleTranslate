Breach Notification
Section 43 of the Act
Data controllers have an obligation to notify the DPC of any breaches within 72 hours of becoming aware of a breach. On the other hand, data processors are required to inform data controllers of any breach within 48 hours of becoming aware of such a breach.
The data controller must notify the data subject of such breach without undue delay.
The Data Protection (General) Regulations, 2021 elaborate in more detail notification of personal data breaches. However, the regulations are yet to be passed into law and are currently awaiting signature by the CS after which they shall be published in the Kenya Gazette. &nbsp;
Under the Regulations, civil registration registries must also notify the DPC of any personal data breach. However, no timelines are stipulated for this requirement. The Regulations also grant the data subject the power to notify the relevant civil registration registry and the DPC where the data subject suspects that their personal data has been breached. This notification must be done within 14 days of such a suspicion.
