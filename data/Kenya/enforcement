The DPC has the duty to ensure the implementation and enforcement of the Act.
The Data Protection (Compliance &amp; Enforcement) Regulation, 2021 sets out the complaints handling procedures and enforcement mechanisms in the event of non-compliance with the provisions of the Act. However, the regulations are yet to be passed into law and are currently awaiting signature by the CS after which they shall be published in the Kenya Gazette. &nbsp;
Section 62 of the Act

In addition, any act which constitutes an offence under the Act where a penalty is not provided attracts a fine of up to Kenya Shillings Three Million (approx. USD 30,000) or imprisonment for up to 10 years or both a fine and imprisonment.Last modified 9 Dec 2021
