The provisions of the Law pertaining to international transfers are broadly drafted.&nbsp;
According to said provisions, international transfers cannot be made without the respect of the following conditions:

To request the authorisation of the CNIL;
To sign with the contracting party, a data confidentiality clause and a data reversibility clause in order to facilitate the complete migration of the data at the end of the contract;
Implement technical and organisational security measures.

Additionally, the transfer can only be made to a foreign country or an international organisation if the beneficiary country or international organisation ensures an adequate level of protection equal to the one ensured in Burkina Faso (Article 42 of the law).&nbsp;
As a signatory to the Marrakech Resolution of 22 November 2013, Burkina Faso recognizes the application of the French-speaking RCE, which consist in a code of conduct by which a group of companies defines its internal policy on the transfer of personal data. The RCE are based and designed on the model of the European Commissionâ€™s binding corporate rules ('BCR').&nbsp;
In practice, the RCE mechanism concerns the authorities of the AFAPDP member countries that have adopted the cooperation protocol and the resolution on the framework for data transfers in the French-speaking area. These concerns at least the following 13 countries: Albania, Andorra, Belgium, Benin, Burkina Faso, France, Gabon, Luxembourg, Mauritius, Morocco, Senegal, Switzerland and Tunisia.&nbsp;
The RCE cover intra-group transfers of personal data carried out by a company established in an AFAPDP member country, to other companies of the group, whether the latter are located in an AFAPDP member country or not.Last modified 10 Jan 2022
