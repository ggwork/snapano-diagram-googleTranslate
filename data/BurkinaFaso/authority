ensuring that the implementation of the right of access and rectification indicated in the acts and declarations do not impede the free exercise of this law
receiving complaints and petitions
staying informed of the latest technological developments, and keeps abreast of their effects on the right to the protection of privacy, the exercise of freedoms, and the functioning of democratic institutions
advising individuals and organisations that use automated processing, or who carry out tests or experiments likely to lead to such processing
responding to requests for public opinion
proposing legislation or regulations to the Government to adapt the protection of freedoms to technological evolution
