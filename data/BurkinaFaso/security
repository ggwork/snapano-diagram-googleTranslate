The personal data Act is not prescriptive about specific technical standards or measures.
However, the Article 24 states that the data controller shall take all necessary measures in view of the nature of the data and the architecture of the processing, in particular to prevent them from being distorted, damaged, lost, stolen or accessed by unauthorised parties.Last modified 10 Jan 2022
