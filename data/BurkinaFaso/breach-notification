Mandatory breach notification
We have not identified, in the law, any general obligation to notify the data subject in the case of a security breach. However, Article 21 of the law provides that in the event where 'information has been transmitted by mistake to a third party, its rectification or cancellation shall be notified to that third party, unless an exemption is granted by the control authority' (i.e. the CIL).Last modified 10 Jan 2022
