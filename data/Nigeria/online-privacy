The Constitutional right to privacy applies to electronic media, including mobile devices and the Internet. Violations of these rights may be subject to civil enforcement.
The NDPR requires all mediums through which Personal Data is collected or processed to display a simple and conspicuous privacy policy, easily understood by the targeted Data Subject class. The privacy policy must contain the following, in addition to any other relevant information:

What constitutes Data Subject consent
Description of Personal Data to be collected
Purpose of Personal Data collection
Technical methods used to collect and store personal information (i.e. cookies, web tokens, etc.)
Access (if any) of third parties to Personal Data and purpose of access
An overview of data processing principles under the NDPR
Available remedies for privacy policy violations
Timeframes associated with available remedies
Any limitation clause, provided that no limitation clause shall avail any Data Controller who acts in breach of the principles of lawful processing set out in the NDPR.
