There is no requirement to report data security breaches or losses to the authorities or to data subjects under the NDPR. However, the Framework mandates Data Controllers to notify NITDA of Personal Data breaches within 72 (seventy-two) hours of becoming aware of the breach. Under the Framework, a Data Controller is also required to immediately notify a Data Subject of a Personal Data breach where the breach will likely result in high risks to the freedoms and rights of the data subject.Last modified 12 Dec 2021
