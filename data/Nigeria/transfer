The NDPR includes provisions on Personal Data transfers to foreign countries and international organizations, provided such transfers are intended for processing purposes. The Honorable Attorney General of the Federation (HAGF) is responsible for supervising such Personal Data transfers.
Personal Data transfers are permitted where NITDA determines that a foreign country, territory or specific sector(s) within a foreign country or international organization provide adequate levels of Personal Data protection. The determination is based on the HAGF’s consideration of the foreign country’s legal system, rule of law, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, as well as relevant general and sector-specific legislation in public security, defense, national security and criminal law.&nbsp;
Personal Data transfers may take place without NITDA or HAGF authorization if:

Data Subject expressly consents to the proposed transfer after being informed of associated risks in the absence of an adequacy determination, the lack of appropriate safeguards, and that there are no alternatives.
Transfer is necessary for the performance of a contract between the Data Subject and the Controller or the implementation of pre-contractual measures taken at the Data Subject's request.
Transfer is necessary for the performance of a contract in the interests of the Data Subject between the Controller and another natural or legal person.
Transfer is necessary for important reasons of public interest.
Transfer is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.
Transfer is necessary to protect the vital interests of the Data Subject or of other persons, where the data subject is physically or legally incapable of giving consent.&nbsp;

Where Personal Data is transferred to a foreign country or to an international organization, the Data Subject shall have the right to be informed of the appropriate safeguards for data protection in the foreign country.Last modified 12 Dec 2021
