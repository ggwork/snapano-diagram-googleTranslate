The Commission will be responsible for creating and maintaining a public register of all data controllers. There is, however, no prescribed method of registration.&nbsp;
A data controller is a person who alone or jointly with others determines the purpose and means of which personal data is to be processed, regardless of whether or not such data is processed by such person or agent on that person's behalf. Additionally, a data controller may engage a data processor, being a person who processes data on behalf of the data controller.&nbsp;&nbsp;
In terms of the DPA, data controllers are required to notify the Commissioner of the Commission (“the Commissioner”) before carrying out any wholly or partially automated processing operation or set of such operations which are intended to serve a single purpose or serve several related purposes. Notification is not required where a data protection representative has been appointed.
The notification should include the following details:&nbsp;

The name and address of the data controller and of its representative;
The purpose of the processing;
A description of the data subjects and of the personal data relating to the data subject;
The recipients to whom personal data can be disclosed to;
Proposed transfers of personal data to a third country; and
A general description to allow the Commission to assess the appropriateness of the security measures.

The requirement for notification does not apply to operations which have the sole purpose of keeping a register that is intended to provide information to the public by virtue of any law, and for which the register is open for public inspection. In addition, the notification will not be required where a data controller has appointed a data protection representative.
Data controllers are further required to immediately notify the Commissioner of any breach to the technical or organizational security safeguards for processing of personal data.
The Commission will have the authority to grant an exemption for notification.Last modified 10 Dec 2021
