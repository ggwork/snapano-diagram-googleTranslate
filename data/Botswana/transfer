The transfer of personal data from Botswana to another country is prohibited save for transborder transfers to countries that have been designated by the Minister through an Order published in the Government Gazette.
Transborder transfers of personal data require prior authorisation to be granted by the Commissioner so as to assess and ensure that adequate levels of protection are provided by the country receiving the personal data. The assessment is in light of all the circumstances surrounding the data transfer operation and particular consideration is given to:

the nature of the data;
the purpose and duration of the proposed processing operation;
the country of origin and the country of final destination;
the rule of law, both general and sectoral, in force in the third country in question; and
the professional rules and security safeguards which are complied with in that country.

Notwithstanding the above, transborder transfers to countries which do not offer an adequate level of protection are allowed where the data subject consents to the proposed transfer or, where the transfer is:

necessary for the performance of a contract between the data subject and the data controller, or the implementation of pre contractual measures taken in response to the data subjectâ€™s request;
necessary for the performance or conclusion of a contract in the interests of the data subject between the data controller and a third party;
necessary for the public interest, or for the establishment, exercise or defence of a legal claim;
necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject; or
made from a register that is intended to provide the public with information and is open to public inspection.

Regardless of the above mentioned restrictions, transborder flow of personal data to a country without adequate levels of protection may be authorised where the data controller provides adequate safeguards which may be by means of appropriate contractual provisions, with respect to the protection of the privacy and fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals.Last modified 10 Dec 2021
