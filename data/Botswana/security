Data controllers are required to take appropriate technical and organisational security measures necessary to protect personal data from negligent or unauthorised destruction, negligent loss, as well as unauthorised access, alteration and processing of personal data.
The measures are influenced by technological developments of processing personal data and the costs for implementing the security measures, as well as the nature of the personal data and the potential risks involved.&nbsp;
Failure to implement the security safeguards amounts to an offence and will render the data controller liable to a fine not exceeding BWP100&nbsp;000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding three years, or to both.Last modified 10 Dec 2021
