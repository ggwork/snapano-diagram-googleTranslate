Marketing by means of electronic communication is governed by the Electronic Communications and Transactions Act&nbsp;– Act No 14 of 2014 (“ECTA”).&nbsp;
An originator, who carries out marketing by means of electronic communication must provide the addressee with the originators’ identity and contact details including the place of business, e-mail, addresses and telefax number, as well as a valid and operational opt-out facility from receiving similar communications in future, and additionally, the identifying particulars of the source from which the originator obtained the addressee’s personal information.&nbsp;
In terms of the ECTA, unsolicited commercial communication must only be sent where the opt in requirement has been met and this includes:&nbsp;

the addressee’s email address and other personal information was collected by the originator of the message in the course of a sale or negotiations for a sale;
the marketing relates to similar products or services;
when the personal information and address was collected by the originator, the originator offered the addressee the opportunity to opt-out, free of charge except for the cost of transmission, and the addressee declined to opt- out; and
the opportunity to opt-out is provided with every subsequent message.

Failure to provide the addressee with an optional opt-out facility is an offence which is punishable by a fine not exceeding BWP10&nbsp;000, or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years, or to both. Furthermore, an originator who persists in sending unsolicited commercial communications to an addressee who has opted-out from receiving such through the originator’s opt out facility commits an offence and is liable to a fine not exceeding BWP50&nbsp;000, or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding eight years, or to both.&nbsp;
Also noteworthy is the DPA requirement that where personal data is processed for direct marketing purposes, the data controller must, at no cost, inform the data subject of the right to oppose the processing. Processing for such purposes will be prohibited where the data subject has given a notice of objection to the processing of the personal data.&nbsp; A data controller who processes the data despite the objection made by the data subject, commits an offence which is punishable by fine not exceeding BWP500&nbsp;000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding nine years, or to both.Last modified 10 Dec 2021
