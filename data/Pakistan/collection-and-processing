Section 16 of PECA 2016 (“Section 16”), reproduced below for ease of reference, puts restriction on the collection and procession of personal data without the consent of the person whose personal data is being collected and processed:
“Whoever obtains, sells, possesses, transmits or uses another person’s identity information without authorization shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years or with fine which may extend to five million rupees, or with both.”
The PDPB, in addition, provides for the imposition of an obligation upon the data controller to intimate to the data subject the following: the collection of personal data pertaining to the data subject; the legal basis of such data collection and data processing; the purpose for such data collection and data processing; the data subject’s right to request access to the personal data so collected and processed; the data subject’s right to request correction of personal data so collected and processed; the class of third parties to whom the personal data may be disclosed; the mandatory or voluntary nature of such data collection and data processing; and the consequences of failing to supply such personal data for data collection and data processing where mandatory. As per the PDPB, where the processing pertains to critical personal data, the PDPB shall (if implemented in its current form) require the same to be processed in a server or data center within Pakistan.
It must be noted, however, that the PDPB is yet to be promulgated into law and therefore the content of the promulgated legislation may differ from the consultation draft.Last modified 1 Feb 2021
