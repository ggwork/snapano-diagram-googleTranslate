Pakistan currently has not enacted data protection legislation per se similar to data protection legislation enacted in other countries of the world, however the Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016 (“PECA 2016”) at present serves the same purpose to a certain extent.
Moreover, a consultation draft of the Personal Data Protection Bill 2020 (“PDPB”) has been introduced by the Ministry of Information Technology and Telecommunications with a view to having the same being promulgated into law after public consultation, approval from both Houses of Parliament and receipt of assent from the President of Pakistan.Last modified 1 Feb 2021
