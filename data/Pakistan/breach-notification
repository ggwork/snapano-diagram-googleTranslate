There is, at present, no requirement to report data breaches to any individual or regulatory body.
However, the PDPB would, upon coming into force, require the data controller to notify the Authority regarding any personal data breaches that are likely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of the data subject. Moreover, the data processor would similarly be required to intimate any breach of personal data to the Authority in the event that the data processor is made aware of such breaches.Last modified 1 Feb 2021
