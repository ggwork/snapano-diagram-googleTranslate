The legislation at present does not provide a comprehensive framework to regulate electronic marketing and the processing or transmission of any personal data as a result of electronic marketing. Section 25 of PECA 2016 however prohibits any person from engaging in spamming (including transmission of harmful, fraudulent, misleading, illegal or unsolicited information), though it may be noted that the aforementioned prohibition is only applicable where such spamming is done by a person for a wrongful gain.Last modified 1 Feb 2021
