Section 16 prohibits the transmission of identity information of a person without consent.
In addition, Pakistan prohibits data transfers to any country that it does not recognize, including: Israel, Taiwan, Somaliland, Nagorno, Karabakh, Transnistria, Abkhazia, Northern Cyprus, Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic, South Ossetia and Armenia. This list may change from time to time. Additionally, data transfers to India must be justifiable by the transferor.
Data collated by banks, insurance firms, hospitals, defense establishments and other ‘sensitive’ institutions may not be transferred to any individual or body without authorization from the relevant regulator on a confidential basis. Such data is further regulated by contractual terms. In certain cases, data may not be transferred without authorization from the data subject.
However, banks and financial institutions must maintain confidentiality in banking transactions.
Similarly, the PDPB, which is yet to be promulgated, proposes prohibiting the transfer of personal data to unauthorized persons or systems. Where the transfer of personal data pertains to a transfer to a territory outside of Pakistan, the PDPB would require the territory where personal data is to be transferred to offer an equivalent degree of personal data protection as that provided for in Pakistan, provided that such data transfer is done in accordance with a framework for the transfer of personal data outside of Pakistan as devised by the Authority.Last modified 1 Feb 2021
