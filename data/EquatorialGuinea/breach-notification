Mandatory breach notification
The law does provide for a mandatory breach duty. Notwithstanding, it provides that in the&nbsp; case of a severe or major breach likely to affect a fundamental right or personal data the sanctioning organ may require the person responsible to restrain the use, communication, give out, or the&nbsp; illegal transfer.Last modified 10 Jan 2022
