The enforcement process applied to determine and impose the sanctions is adjusted to the principles, rules and norms of administrative procedure at the request of an audience by the interested party. During the audience, other enforcement measures can be adopted by the sanctioning organ to ensure compliance of the final resolution and to secure the application of the sanctions. However, these measures have a provisional character (art.45).&nbsp;
Where the infringement is committed in a public file, the sanctioning organ has to pass a resolution ordering the dismissal or correction of the infringement, as well as propose the application of disciplinary proceedings against the offenders (art.45).&nbsp;
The resolution of the sanctioning organ is elevated to a higher authority, which must then verify and determine the applicable sanctions against the infringement.Last modified 10 Jan 2022
