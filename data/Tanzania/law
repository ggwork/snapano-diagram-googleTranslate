There is no one specific standalone law on data protection in Tanzania. Article 16 of the Constitution of the United Republic of Tanzania, 1977 (“Constitution”) affords a fundamental right to privacy. This right encompasses private and family life, home and private communication including mail, telephone communications and emails in the workplace and has wide ranging applications including data protection.&nbsp;
As a result, there are sector specific legislations which impose data protection principles and rules that should be followed by those engaged in the processing of personal data, e.g., in the electronic and postal communication sector and the financial sector, the health sector. Below are examples of some of the applicable laws:

The Electronic and Postal Communications Act, 2010 (“EPOCA”)
The Electronic and Postal Communications (Consumer Protection) Regulations, GN. No. 61 of 2018 (“Consumer Protection Regulations”)
The Electronic and Postal Communications (Licensing) Regulations, 2018 (“Licensing Regulations”)
The Electronic and Postal Communications (Computer Emergency Response Team) Regulations, 2018 (“CERT Regulations”)
The National Payment System Act, 2015 (“NPS Act”)
The Bank of Tanzania (Financial Consumer Protection) Regulations, 2019 (“Financial Consumer Protection”)
