Any transfer of personal data requires justification and must be in accordance with the law (i.e., legal procedures laid down by state authority).&nbsp;
For instance, EPOCA restricts transfers of personal data (including outside Tanzania) by electronic communications services and postal services licensees. Such data may only be transferred if the following conditions are met:

the transfer is in accordance with the terms and conditions agreed with the data subject; and either
the TCRA has approved or permitted the transfer; or
the transfer is permitted or required by any applicable law.&nbsp;

Financial service providers can only transfer personal data of consumers with the consent of the data subject unless otherwise authorized by the law or court order.Last modified 21 Feb 2022
