There is no specific national data protection authority. The relevant authority depends on the affected sector. For instance, Tanzania Communications Regulatory Authority (TCRA) is the national data protection authority in relation to electronic and postal communications and the Bank of Tanzania (BOT) is the national data protection authority for financial services.Last modified 21 Feb 2022
