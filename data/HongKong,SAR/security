Data users are required by the Ordinance to take all practical steps to ensure that personal data is protected against unauthorized or accidental access, processing, erasure, loss or use, having regard to factors including the nature of the personal data and the harm that could result if data breaches or leaks were to occur.
Where the data user engages a data processor to process personal data on its behalf, the data user must use contractual or other means to:

Prevent unauthorized or accidental access, processing, erasure, or loss of use of the personal data, and

Ensure that the data processor does not retain the personal data for longer than necessary


The Consultation Paper proposes to require organizations to formulate and publish a clear data retention policy specifying retention period(s) for personal data collected.Last modified 22 Dec 2021
