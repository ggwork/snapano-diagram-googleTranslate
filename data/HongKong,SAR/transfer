Data users may not transfer personal data to third parties (including affiliates) unless the data subject has been informed of the following on or before their personal data was collected:

That their personal data may be transferred


The classes of persons to whom the data may be transferred

There are currently no restrictions on transfer of personal data outside of Hong Kong, as the cross-border transfer restrictions set out in section 33 of the Ordinance were held back and have not yet come into force. A proposal to implement section 33 (perhaps with amendments) was put forward to the Hong Kong government in 2015, but this process has been delayed. Notably, however, these were not included in the Consultation Paper. If these restrictions come into force as currently drafted, they will have a significant impact upon outsourcing arrangements, intragroup data sharing arrangements, compliance with overseas reporting obligations and other activities that involve cross-border data transfer.
Nevertheless, non-binding best practice guidance published by the PCPD encourages compliance with the cross-border transfer restrictions in section 33 of the Ordinance, which prohibit the transfer of personal data to a place outside Hong Kong unless certain conditions are met (including a white list of jurisdictions; separate and voluntary consent obtained from the data subject; and an enforceable data transfer agreement for which the PCPD provides suggested model clauses).Last modified 22 Dec 2021
