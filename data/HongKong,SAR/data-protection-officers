Currently, there is no legal requirement for data users to appoint a data protection officer in Hong Kong. However, in February 2014, the PCPD issued a best practice guide to advocate the development of a privacy management program and encourage data users to appoint or designate a responsible person to oversee the data users' compliance with the Ordinance. This role may or may not be a full-time job, and there is no specific requirement for a Hong Kong citizen or resident to hold this role. There is no specific enforcement action or penalty if a company does not appoint a data protection officer.Last modified 22 Dec 2021
