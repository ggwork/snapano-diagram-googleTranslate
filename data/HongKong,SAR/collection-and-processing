A "data user" (which is akin to a "data controller" under GDPR) may collect personal data from a data subject if:

The personal data is collected for a lawful purpose directly related to a function or activity of the data user


The collection is necessary for or directly related to that purpose


The data to be collected is adequate but not excessive, and


All practical steps have been taken to ensure that the data subject has been informed, on or before collection of the data, of the following:



Whether the supply of personal data by the data subject is obligatory or voluntary and, if obligatory, the consequences of not supplying the data




The purposes for which the data will be used




The persons to whom the data may be transferred




The data subject's right to request for access to and correction of their personal data, and




The name or job title, and address, of the individual to whom requests for access or correction should be sent


Separately, additional notice requirements apply to direct marketing (see below).
Data users may only collect, use and transfer personal data for purposes notified to the data subject on collection (see above), unless a limited exemption set out in the Ordinance applies. Any usage or transfer of personal data for new purposes requires the prescribed consent of the data subject.
Data users are also required to take all practicable steps to ensure the accuracy and security of the personal data; to ensure it is not kept longer than necessary for the fulfillment of the purposes for which it is to be used (including any directly related purpose); and to keep and make generally available their policies and practices in relation to personal data.
While the Ordinance currently does not regulate data processors, the Consultation Paper proposes to regulate data processors directly and impose direct liability on them regarding data retention, data security and data breach notification.
In October 2018, the PCPD published a "New Ethical Accountability framework." Under the framework, the PCPD is effectively urging businesses operating in Hong Kong to undertake privacy impact assessments â€“ referred to as "Ethical Data Impact Assessments", which are already required to some extent under a number of other laws, such as China, the Philippines as well as GDPR. More recently in 2019, the PCPD further noted that such framework and the concept of data ethics and stewardship in the development are beneficial to fintech applications.Last modified 22 Dec 2021
