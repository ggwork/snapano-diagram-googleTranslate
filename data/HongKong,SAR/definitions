Definition of personal data
Personal data is defined in the Ordinance as any data:

Relating directly or indirectly to a living individual


From which it is practicable for the identity of the individual to be directly or indirectly ascertained, and


In a form in which access to or processing of the data is practicable

The Consultation Paper proposes to expand the definition of personal data to cover anonymized information where the relevant individual can be re-identified.
Definition of sensitive personal data
There is not a separate concept of sensitive personal data in the Ordinance. However, non-binding guidance issued by the Office of the Privacy Commissioner for Personal Data (PCPD) (in the context of biometric data) has indicated that higher standards should be applied as a matter of best practice to more sensitive personal data.Last modified 22 Dec 2021
