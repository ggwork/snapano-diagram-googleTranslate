Specific provisions of the Ordinance govern the use and sharing of personal data for the purposes of direct marketing (meaning the offering, or advertising the availability of goods, facilities or services, or the solicitation of donations or contributions for charitable, cultural, philanthropic, recreational, political or other purposes), when such marketing is conducted through "direct marketing means" (being the sending of information or goods, addressed to specific persons by name, by mail, fax, electronic mail or other means of communication; or making telephone calls to specific persons).
The direct marketing provisions generally require data users who wish to use personal data for the data user's own direct marketing purposes to obtain prior consent from the data subject for such action and notify the data subject as follows:

That the data user intends to use the individual's personal data for direct marketing

That the data user may not so use the personal data unless the data subject has received the data subject's consent to the intended use


The kind(s) of personal data to be used


The class(es) of marketing subjects (i.e.&nbsp;goods / services to be marketed) in relation to which the data is to be used, and

The response channel through which the individual may, without charge, communicate the individual's consent to the intended use

Furthermore, if the consent was given orally, data users have the additional obligation to send a written confirmation to the data subject confirming the particulars of the consent received.
The direct marketing provisions generally require data users who wish to share personal data with a group company or a third party for their direct marketing purposes (e.g.&nbsp;for joint marketing, or in connection with a sale of a marketing list) to obtain their prior written consent and to notify the data subject as follows:


That the data user intends to provide the individual's personal data to another person for use by that person in direct marketing


That the data user may not so provide the data unless the data user has received the individual's written consent to the intended provision


That the provision of the personal data is for gain (if it is to be so provided)


The kind(s) of personal data to be provided


The class(es) of persons to which the data is to be provided


The class(es) of marketing subjects (i.e.&nbsp;goods/services to be marketed) in relation to which the data is to be used, and

The response channel through which the individual may, without charge, communicate the individual's consent to the intended use

When data users use personal data for the purposes of direct marketing for the first time, they must inform the subjects that they may opt out at any time, free of charge. In practice, it is common for subsequent direct marketing communications in Hong Kong to contain unsubscribe functions, not just in the first message.
Hong Kong's anti-spam framework is set out in the Unsolicited Electronic Messages Ordinance (Cap. 593), under which three types of Do-Not-Call (DNC) registers are maintained, namely the DNC for fax, short messages and pre-recorded telephone messages. Person-to-person telemarketing calls are not regulated by this framework.
In 2019, a legislative proposal was published to implement the new DNC to provide an "opt out" framework to permit recipients to request to stop receiving person-to-person telemarketing calls. The Government is currently drafting the relevant bill.Last modified 22 Dec 2021
