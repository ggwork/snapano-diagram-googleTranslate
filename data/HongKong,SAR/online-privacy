The principles as stated in the Ordinance also apply in the online environment. For example, under the Ordinance, data users have the obligation to inform data subjects of the purposes for collecting their personal data, even if personal data is collected through the Internet. If a website uses cookies to collect personal data from its visitors, this should be made known to them. Data users should also inform the visitors whether and how non-acceptance of the cookies will affect the functionality of the website.&nbsp;
With the coming into effect of the Amendment Ordinance, a new anti-doxxing law is now in force in Hong Kong. It is now an offence to disclose any personal data without the data subjectâ€™s consent with an intent to cause harm to the data subject or any family member of the data subject.Last modified 22 Dec 2021
