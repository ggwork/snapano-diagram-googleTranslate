The Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance (Cap. 486) (Ordinance) regulates the collection and handling of personal data. The Ordinance has been in force since 1996, but in 2012/2013 was significantly amended (notably with regard to direct marketing). Most recently, the Personal Data (Privacy) (Amendment) Ordinance (“Amendment Ordinance”) came into force in October 2021 and introduces new offences of doxxing and corresponding penalties.
At Bill stage, the Amendment Ordinance had originally included a number of other proposed amendments by the PDPO (as per the January 2020 consultation paper): the other amendments are still being considered by the Legislative Council and there is no indication of when these might be passed.Last modified 22 Dec 2021
