Currently there is no mandatory requirement under the Ordinance for data users to notify authorities or data subjects about data breaches in Hong Kong. However, according to non-binding guidance issued by the PCPD, as a matter of best practice the PCPD encourages notification to the PCPD, and to data subjects where there would be a risk of harm by not notifying. There is a template form to this end on the PCPD website.
Recent high profile data incidents have led regulators and politicians to consider introducing more stringent breach notification rules. The PCPD has already hinted at increased use of compliance checks and greater publication of investigation reports as part of "fair" enforcement of the law. Now the Consultation Paper proposes mandatory breach notification requirement for organizations to notify a data incident to both the PCPD and the impacted data subjects within the prescribed period where there is a real risk of significant harm.Last modified 22 Dec 2021
