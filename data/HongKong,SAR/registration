Currently, there is no requirement for organizations that control the collection and use of personal data (known as "data users") to register with the data protection authority. &nbsp;
However, under the Ordinance the PCPD has the power to specify certain classes of data users to whom registration and reporting obligations apply. Under the Data User Return Scheme (DURS), data users belonging to the specified classes are required to submit data returns containing prescribed information to the PCPD, which will compile them into a central register accessible by the public. However, at the time of writing, no register has been created to date. The PCPD has proposed to implement the DURS in phases, with the initial phase covering data users from the following sectors and industries:

The public sector
Banking, insurance and telecommunications industries, and
Organizations with a large database of members (eg, customer loyalty schemes)

A public consultation for the DURS by the PCPD was concluded in September 2011. The PCPD had originally planned to implement the DURS in the second half of 2013. However, in January 2014, the PCPD indicated that it planned to put the DURS on hold until the reforms of the European Union (EU) data protection system have been finalized (as the Hong Kong model is broadly based on the same) but no exact time frame for the implementation has been announced. In light of&nbsp;the European Union General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (GDPR), which generally eliminated the data processing registration requirements under EU data protection law, it is unclear now whether the PCPD will implement the Hong Kong DURS scheme.Last modified 22 Dec 2021
