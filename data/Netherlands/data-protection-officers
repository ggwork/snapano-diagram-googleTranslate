Each controller or processor is required to appoint a data protection officer if it satisfies one or more of the following tests:

It is a public authority
Its core activities consist of processing operations which, by virtue of their nature, scope or purposes, require regular and systemic monitoring of data subjects on a large scale
Its core activities consist of processing sensitive personal data on a large scale

Groups of undertakings are permitted to appoint a single data protection officer with responsibility for multiple legal entities (Article 37(2)), provided that the data protection officer is easily accessible from each establishment (meaning that larger corporate groups may find it difficult in practice to operate with a single data protection officer).
DPOs must have expert knowledge (Article 37(5)) of data protection laws and practices, though it is possible to outsource the DPO role to a service provider (Article 37(6)).
Controllers and processors are required to ensure that the DPO is involved "properly and in a timely manner in all issues which relate to the protection of personal data" (Article 38(1)), and the DPO must directly report to the highest management level, must not be told what to do in the exercise of his or her tasks and must not be dismissed or penalised for performing those tasks (Article 38(3)).
The specific tasks of the DPO, set out in GDPR, include (Article 39):

To inform and advise on compliance with GDPR and other Union and Member State data protection laws
To monitor compliance with the law and with the internal policies of the organization including assigning responsibilities, awareness raising and training staff
To advise and monitor data protection impact assessments where requested
To cooperate and act as point of contact with the supervisory authority

This is a good example of an area of the GDPR where Member State gold plating laws are likely. For example, German domestic law has set the bar for the appointment of DPOs considerably lower than that set out in the GDPR.The Implementation Act (Article 39) provides more detailed information regarding the secrecy requirement set out in Article 38(5) GDPR, by stipulating that the DPO must maintain the secrecy of any information that becomes known to him or her pursuant to a complaint by or request from a data subject, unless the data subject agrees to disclosure.
Organisations must register their DPO with the Dutch Data Protection Authority (Autoriteit Persoonsgegevens). The registration form is available here.&nbsp;
A special email address and phone number is available for registered DPOs to contact the Dutch Data Protection Authority in case of questions with regard to the tasks of DPOs and GDPR compliance.&nbsp;
