Enforcement of the GDPR is the prerogative of data protection regulators, known as supervisory authorities (for example, the Cnil in France or the ICO in the UK). The European Data Protection Board (the replacement for the so-called Article 29 Working Party) is comprised of delegates from the supervisory authorities, and monitors the application of the GDPR across the EU, issuing guidelines to encourage consistent interpretation of the Regulation.
The GDPR creates the concept of "lead supervisory authority". Where there is cross-border processing of personal data (ie, processing taking place in establishments of a controller or processor in multiple Member States, or taking place in a single establishment of a controller or processor but affecting data subjects in multiple Member States), then the starting point for enforcement is that controllers and processors are regulated by and answer to the supervisory authority for their main or single establishment, the so-called "lead supervisory authority" (Article 56(1)).
However, the lead supervisory authority is required to cooperate with all other "concerned" authorities, and a supervisory authority in another Member State may enforce where infringements occur on its territory or substantially affect data subjects only in its territory (Article 56(2)).
The concept of lead supervisory authority is therefore of somewhat limited help to multinationals.The PDPA specifies that in the meaning of article 51(1) of the GDPR the independent supervisory authority of Estonia shall be the Estonian Data Protection Inspectorate (DPI). The PDPA further specifies the requirements for and appointing of the head of the DPI.
In addition to the tasks provided in Article 57 of the GDPR, the PDPA specifies that the DPI is competent to:

raise awareness and understanding of the public, the controllers and processors about the risks of processing personal data, the standards and safeguards applicable to processing, and the rights related to the processing of personal data; The DPI may provide indicative guidance for this task;
provide information to the data subject, upon request, about the exercise of his rights under this PDPI and, if necessary, cooperate with other supervisory authorities of the European Union Member States for this purpose;
initiate, where necessary, misdemeanor proceedings and impose sanctions in the event where it is not possible to achieve compliance with the requirements provided by law or GDPR with the application of other administrative measures;
cooperate with international data protection supervisory organizations and other data protection supervisory authorities and other competent authorities and persons of foreign states;
monitor relevant trends insofar as they affect the protection of personal data, in particular the development of information and communication technology;
participate in the European Data Protection Board;
apply administrative coercion to the extent and pursuant to the procedure prescribed by law;
submit opinions to the Estonian parliament, the Government of the Republic, the Chancellor of Justice and other institutions and the public on its own initiative or upon request on issues related to the protection of personal data;
perform other duties arising from law.

In addition to the rights and powers under the GDPR the PDPA specifies that the DPI has the right to:

warn the controller and the processor that the data processing activities are likely to violate the PDPA;
demand the rectification of personal data;
demand the deletion of personal data;
demand restriction of processing of personal data;
demand the termination of the processing of personal data, including destruction or archiving;
implement organizational, physical and informational security measures for the protection of personal data without delay, if necessary, in accordance with the procedure provided for by the Substitutive Enforcement and Penalty Payment Act, if necessary, in order to prevent damage to the rights and freedoms of a person, unless personal data are processed by a public authority;
impose a temporary or permanent restriction on the processing of personal data, including a prohibition on the processing of personal data;
initiate state supervisory proceedings on the basis of a complaint or on its own initiative.
