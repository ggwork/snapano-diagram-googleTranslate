The Dubai Healthcare City ("DHCC"), a healthcare free zone in Dubai, implemented DHCC Health Data Protection Regulation No 7 of 2013&nbsp; (which repealed and replaces the DHCC Data Protection regulation No. 7 of 2008) ("HDPR").
The HDPR regulates the protection of Patient Health Information, as opposed 'personal data'.
Note that as opposed to the ICT Health Law, which applies to entities across the UAE, including within freezones such as the DHCC (please see UAE – General), the DHCC HDPR only applies to those entities licensed within the DHCC and to patient information generated and stored therein.Last modified 21 Jan 2021
