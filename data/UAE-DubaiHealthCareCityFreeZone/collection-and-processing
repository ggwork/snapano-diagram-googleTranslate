Patient Health Information is not permitted to be collected by any Licensee, unless it is for a lawful purpose, and the collection is necessary for that purpose (article 27 HDPR). However, the meaning of lawful purpose is not defined in the HDPR.
The Patient Health Information should be collected from the patient directly, unless the Lisensee believes on reasonable grounds that:

the Patient concerned authorizes Collection of the information from someone else having been made aware of the matters set out in section 29(1);
the Patient is unable to give his authority, and the Licensee having made the Patient’s Representative aware of the matters set out in section 29(1) Collects the Patient Health Information from the Representative or the Representative authorizes Collection from someone else;
compliance would prejudice the: (i) interests of the Patient; or (ii) purposes of collection; or (iii) safety of any individual;
compliance is not reasonably practicable in the circumstances of the particular case;
the Collection is for the purpose of assembling a family or genetic history of a Patient and is collected directly from that Patient and/or the Patient’s Representative;
the Patient Health Information is Publicly Available Information;
the Patient Health Information: (i) shall not be used in a form in which the Patient is identified; (ii) shall be used for statistical purposes and shall not be published in a form that could reasonably be expected to identify the Patient; or (iii) shall be used for research purposes (for which approval by an ethics committee, if required, has been given) and shall not be published in a form that could reasonably be expected to identify the Patient; or
non-compliance is necessary: (i) to avoid prejudice to the maintenance of the law including the prevention, detection, investigation, prosecution, and punishment of offences; (ii) for the conduct of proceedings before any court or tribunal (being proceedings that have been commenced or are reasonably in contemplation) (section 28 HDPR).
