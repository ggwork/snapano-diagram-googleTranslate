Patient Health Information may only be transferred to a third party located in a jurisdiction outside DHCC if (1) an adequate level of protection for that Patient Health Information is ensured by the laws and regulations that are applicable to the third party; and (2) the transfer is either: (a) authorized by the Patient; or (b) necessary for the ongoing provision of Healthcare Services to the Patient.
A jurisdiction shall be considered to have an adequate level of protection if that jurisdiction is listed as an acceptable jurisdiction under the Dubai International Financial Center Data Protection Law No. 1 of 2007, or has the written approval of the Central Governance Board.
The DHCC Healthcare Data Protection Regulation of 2008 contained a provision which permitted the transfer of Patient Heath Information to a jurisdiction without adequate protection, if a permit was sought. However, this was removed under the HDPL and the Central Government Board does not have the power to issue permits in respect of transfer to jurisdictions without an adequate level of protection.Last modified 21 Jan 2021
