Data Protection Law provides for the legal obligation of every controller to notify the Commissioner on the processing of personal data for which it is responsible. The notification shall be made before the controller processes the data for the first time, or when a change of the processing notification status is required.&nbsp;
The notification shall contain the name and address of the controller, the purpose of personal data processing, the categories of data subjects and personal data, the recipients and categories of the recipients of personal data, the proposal on the international transfers that the controller aims to carry out and a general description of the measures for the security of personal data. The notification is done either online, on the website of the Commissioner, or manually, by submitting the competed notification form to the Commissioner's Office.&nbsp;
The information submitted by the data controller through the notification, except for the general description of the measures for the security of personal data, shall be published by the Commissionerâ€™s Office on the Electronic Register of Controllers which is accessible by the public on the official website.
The notification process and the publication of the information it contains is fundamental to ensure transparency for the public and consequently to protect personal data. Through the access to the Electronic Register of Controllers, the public has the means of understanding how personal data are processed by the controlling entities.&nbsp;
The failure of the controlling entities to comply with the obligation to notify the Commissioner constitutes an administrative offence and is punishable by a fine.&nbsp;
However, there are cases when the controllers are exempted from the notification obligation as follows:&nbsp;

The processing of personal data is performed in order to keep a register, which in accordance with the law or sub-legal acts provides information for the public;
The processing of personal data is performed in order to protect the constitutional institutions, national security interests, foreign policies, economic or financial interests of the state, or for the prevention or prosecution of criminal offences;
The processing of data is done pursuant to Decision of the Commissioner No. 4 "On the Determination of the Cases Exempted from the Notification Obligation of the Personal Data which are Processed", dated 27 December 2012.
