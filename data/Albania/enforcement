The Commissioner is the competent authority for the supervision and enforcement of Data Protection Law. The Commissioner has the right to:&nbsp;

conduct administrative investigations, have access to personal data processing and collect all the necessary information in order to fulfil his supervisory obligations;
order the blocking, erasure, destruction or suspension of the unlawful processing of personal data;
give instructions prior to the processing of data and ensure their publication.&nbsp;

In cases of recurring or intentional serious infringement of the Data Protection Law by a controller or processor, the Commissioner acts in compliance with article 39 of Data Protection Law and reports the case publicly or reports it to the Parliament and the Council of Ministers.&nbsp;
Article 39 (1) of Data Protection Law specifies that data processing in violation of the Data Protection Law constitutes administrative offences and may be subject to administrative fines which vary from 10,000 ALL (approx. 83 EUR) to 1,000,000 ALL (approx. 8300 EUR), with legal persons being subject to double the amount specified herein.&nbsp;
Data Protection Law also states that the fine is doubled when the following provisions are breached:&nbsp;

When the data subject has filed a complaint, the controller shall have no right to make any changes to the personal data until a final decision is reached.
The Commissioner is responsible for authorizing, in special cases, the use of personal data for purposes not designated during the phase of their collection in compliance with the principles of the Data Protection Law.&nbsp;

The sanctioned subject may appeal the fine in court within the deadlines and according to the procedures that regulate the administrative trials.&nbsp;
Fines shall be paid no later than 30 days from their issuing. When the deadline expires, the decision becomes an executive title and is executed in a mandatory manner by the bailiff's office, upon request of the Commissioner. Fines are cashed in the state budget.&nbsp;
In case the offence consists in a crime, the Commissioner files the relevant criminal charges with the competent law enforcement authorities.Last modified 22 Dec 2021
