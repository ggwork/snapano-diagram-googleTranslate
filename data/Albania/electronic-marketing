Data Protection Law provides that the collection of personal data related to a data subject, solely for reasons of direct marketing is allowed only if the data subject has given his explicit consent.&nbsp;
Data Protection Law defines direct marketing as the communication of the promotional material, by every means and way, using personal data of legal or natural persons, agencies or other entities with or without interference.&nbsp;
Moreover, the data subject has the right to demand the controller not to start processing, or in case the processing has started, to stop processing personal data related to him for the purposes of direct marketing and to be informed in advance before personal data are disclosed for the first time for such purpose.&nbsp;
The Commissioner has issued an Instruction no. 06, dated 28 May 2010 "On the correct use of SMSs for promotional purposes, advertising, information, direct sales, via mobile phone". This instruction emphasizes the importance of the prior consent given by the data subject.&nbsp;
In addition, pursuant to article 124 of the Electronic Communications Law, electronic communications service providers may process traffic data for marketing purposes only after prior approval by the subscriber. Subscribers should be informed on the type of traffic data being processed, before give approval for their processing. Subscribers and users have the right to withdraw to any time from the approval they have made.Last modified 22 Dec 2021
