Data Protection Law does not provide for a general obligation of the data controller or data processor to notify the Commissioner in case of personal data breach.&nbsp;
However, pursuant to Instruction No. 47, dated 14 September 2018 "On the Determination of Rules for Maintaining the Security of Personal Data Processed by Large Processing Entities", which, as mentioned above applies only to large data processing entities, the DPO shall promptly notify the large data processing entity in writing of any risk of violation of the data subjects' rights, including in case of the violation of personal data protection legislation.&nbsp;
In the event that, following the notification of the DPO, the large data processing entity fails to take appropriate measures to address the problem in a timely manner, the DPO notifies the Commissioner without delay. Therefore, in case of breach of data handled by a large data processing entity, resulting from the violation of violation of the data subjects' rights, or from the violation of personal data protection legislation, which has not been addressed effectively, the DPO has the obligation to notify the Commissioner.&nbsp;
It should also be noted, that pursuant to an opinion of the Commissioner on the protection of personal data on the websites of public and private controllers, data subjects have the right to be notified by the data controller if their personal data have been compromised (data has been lost or stolen, or if their online privacy is likely to be negatively affected). To the best of our understanding the opinion expressed by the Commissioner in this opinion, merely serves as a guideline and has not a binding effect.&nbsp;
On the other hand, Law No. 9918, dated 19 May 2008 "On Electronic Communications in the Republic of Albania", as amended ("Electronic Communications Law"), (Official Gazette of the Republic of Albania No. 84, dated 10 June 2008) provides for another breach notification procedure.&nbsp;
The Electronic Communications Law defines personal data breach as any breach of security leading to the destruction, loss, alteration or unauthorized distribution, accidental or unlawful, or access to personal data transmitted, stored or processed, in connection with the provision of an electronic communications service available to the public.&nbsp;
Pursuant to article 122 of the Electronic Communications Law, entrepreneurs of public electronic communications networks and services are under the obligation to, individually or when necessary, in cooperation with each-other, implement technical and organizational measures, to ensure the security of networks and/or services, provided by them.&nbsp;
These measures are meant to ensure an adequate level of protection and security of personal data against potential, foreseeable risks. With respect to the personal data of the users, entrepreneurs of public electronic communications networks and services are under the obligation to inform their users about any specific risk, how the risk can be reduced by the users, as well as the possible costs, which must be covered by the user, if the risk that happens is beyond the measures that the entrepreneur can take.&nbsp;
In addition, in case of personal data breach, the entrepreneur who provides electronic communications services available to the public promptly notifies the Authority of Electronic and Postal Communications ("AEPC"). When the breach of personal data may adversely affect the personal data and privacy of the subscriber or individual, the entrepreneur shall also promptly notify the said subscriber or individual.&nbsp;
However, if the entrepreneur has proved to the AEPC that it has implemented the necessary technological protection measures and these measures have been applied to the relevant data, then the entrepreneur is not required to notify the subscriber or the individual of the violation of personal data. These technological safeguards ensure that the personal data become illegible to any person who does not have authorized access to the data.Last modified 22 Dec 2021
