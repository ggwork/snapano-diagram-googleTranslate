The Republic of Albania regulates personal data protection pursuant to Law No. 9887, dated 10 March 2008 "On Protection of Personal Data", as amended ("Data Protection Law") (Official Gazette of the Republic of Albania No. 44, dated 1 April 2008). The Data Protection Law was last amended in 2014, thus it is yet to be harmonized with the Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data ("GDPR").&nbsp;
The complete harmonization of the current Albanian legislation in force on data protection with the GDPR has been one of the main objectives of the Office of Information and Data Protection Commissioner since 2018, however this objective has yet to be achieved (due in part to the Covid-19 pandemic).Last modified 22 Dec 2021
