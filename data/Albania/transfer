The international transfer of personal data may be carried out with recipients from states which have an adequate level of personal data protection. The level of personal data protection for a state is established by assessing all circumstances related to the nature, purpose and duration of the processing, the country of origin and final destination, as well as the legal provisions and security standards in force in the recipient state.&nbsp;
Pursuant to the Decision of the Commissioner No. 8, dated 31 October 2016 the following states have an adequate level of data protection:

European Union member states;
European Economic Area states;
Parties to the Convention No. 108 of the Council of Europe "For the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data", as well as its 1981 Protocol, which have approved a special law and set up a supervisory authority that operates in complete independence, providing appropriate legal mechanisms, including handling complaints, investigating and ensuring the transparency of personal data processing;
States where personal data may be transferred, pursuant to a decision of the European Commission.&nbsp;

International transfer of personal data with a state that does not have an adequate level of personal data protection may be done if:

it is authorized by international acts ratified by the Republic of Albania and are directly applicable;
the data subject has given his consent for the international transfer;
the transfer is necessary for the performance of a contract between the data subject and the controller or for the implementation of pre-contractual measures taken in addressing a request of the data subject, or the transfer is necessary for the conclusion or performance of a contract between the controller and a third party, in the interest of the data subject;
it is a legal obligation of the controller;
it is necessary for protecting vital interests of the data subject;
it is necessary or constitutes a legal requirement over an important public interest or for exercising and protecting a legal right;
it is done from a register that is open for consultation and provides information to the general public.&nbsp;

Pursuant to the Data Protection Law, the Commissioner issues instructions in order to allow certain categories of personal data to be transferred to a state that does not have an adequate level of personal data protection. In these cases, the controller is exempted from the authorization request. Accordingly, the Commissioner has issued the Instruction No. 41, dated 13 June 2014 "On Allowing some Categories of International Transfers of Personal Data in a Country that does not have an Adequate Level of Personal Data Protection".&nbsp;
Controllers wishing to transfer personal data to other countries lacking adequate personal data protection, may fill in an application form "For the Approval of the Transfer of Personal Data to a State that does not have an Adequate Level of Data Protection, through the Authorization of the Commissioner".&nbsp;
In 2014, the Commissioner has also issued a Manual on the International Transfer of Personal Data which provides guidelines to the international transfer of personal data.&nbsp;
The exchange of personal data with the diplomatic representations of foreign governments or international institutions in the Republic of Albania shall be considered an international transfer of data.Last modified 22 Dec 2021
