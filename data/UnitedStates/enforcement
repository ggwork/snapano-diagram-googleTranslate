Various entities enforce US national and state privacy laws.&nbsp;Violations of privacy laws and rules are generally enforced by the FTC, state attorneys general or the regulator for the industry sector in question. Civil penalties can be significant.
In addition, individuals may bring private rights of action (and class actions) for certain privacy or security violations.
Some privacy laws (for example, credit reporting, marketing and electronic communications, video viewing history, call recording and cable communications privacy laws) may be enforced through private rights of action, which give rise to class action lawsuits for significant statutory damages and attorney’s fees, and individuals may bring actions for actual damages from data breaches.
As of January 1, 2020, California law (the CCPA) now provides individuals with a private right of action and statutory damages, in the event of certain breaches of unencrypted personal information,&nbsp;where a business has failed to implement reasonable data security procedures (this applies to most categories of personal information under California’s breach notification law) – this raises significant class action risks.
In June 2018, Ohio became the first US state to pass cybersecurity safe harbor legislation. Under SB 220, a company that has suffered a data breach of personal information has an affirmative defense if it has ‘created, maintained, and complied with a written cybersecurity program that contains administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect personal information that reasonably conforms to an industry recognized cybersecurity framework’ (eg, PCI-DSS standards, NIST Framework, NIST special publications 800-171, 800-53, and 800-53a, FedRAMP security assessment framework, HIPAA, GLBA).Last modified 24 Jan 2022
