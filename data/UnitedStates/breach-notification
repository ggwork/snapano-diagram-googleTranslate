All 50 US states, Washington, DC, and most US territories (including, Puerto Rico, Guam and the Virgin Islands) have passed breach notification laws that require notifying state residents of a security breach involving more sensitive categories of information, such as Social Security numbers and other government identifiers, credit card and financial account numbers, health or medical information, insurance ID, tax ID, birthdate, as well as online account credentials, digital signatures and/or biometrics.
Under many state laws, where more than 500 individuals are impacted, notice is must also be provided to credit bureaus. Nearly half of states also require notice to state attorneys general and / or other state officials of certain data breaches. Also, some state data breach laws impose certain (varying) notice content and timing requirements with respect to notice to individuals and to state attorneys general and/or other state officials.
Federal laws require notification in the case of breaches of healthcare information, breaches of information from financial institutions, breaches of telecom usage information held by telecommunication providers, and breaches of government agency information.Last modified 24 Jan 2022
