US privacy laws and self-regulatory principles vary widely, but generally require that a notice be provided or made available pre-collection&nbsp;(eg,&nbsp;in a privacy policy) that discloses a company's collection, use and disclosure practices, the related choices consumers have regarding their personal information, and the company's contact information.
Opt-in consent is required under certain circumstance to collect, use and disclose certain sensitive data, such as health information, credit reports, financial information, children’s personal information, biometric data, video viewing choices, geolocation data and telecommunication usage information.&nbsp; &nbsp;
The CPA (Colorado) and VCDPA (Virginia) require a business obtain consent from consumers &nbsp;to collect their sensitive data.
The (federal) Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) requires verifiable parental consent prior to the collection of any personal information from children under 13. In addition, the CCPA and CPRA require that a business obtain explicit consent prior to the sale of any personal information about a consumer that the business has "actual knowledge" is less than 16 years old, and where the consumer is less than 13 years old, express parental authorization is required. (As discussed further below, the definition of "sale" under the CCPA is very broad and may include online advertising and retargeting activities, for example.). Under the CPRA, this concept expands to the concept of “sharing” a minor’s consumer personal information (as such term is broadly defined under the CPRA).
Further, companies generally need to obtain opt-in consent prior to using, disclosing or otherwise treating personal information in a manner that is materially different than what was disclosed in the privacy policy applicable when the personal information was collected. The FTC deems such changes ‘retroactive material changes’ and considers it unfair and deceptive to implement a retroactive material change without obtaining prior, affirmative consent. Under the CCPA (California), which applies to individual and household data about California residents, businesses must, among other things:

At or before collection, notify consumers of the categories of personal information to be collected and the purposes of use of such information
Post a privacy policy that discloses

the categories of personal information collected, categories of personal information disclosed for a business purpose, and categories of personal information "sold" by the business in the prior 12 months&nbsp;
the purposes for which the business collects, uses and sells personal information
the categories of sources from which&nbsp;the business collects personal information
the categories of third parties to whom the business discloses personal information and
the rights consumers have regarding their personal information and how to exercise those rights

Includes a “do-not-sell my information” link on the business's website and page where consumers can opt-out of the sale of their personal information (if applicable)
Generally, provide at least two methods for consumers to submit CCPA requests to the business, including an online method (e.g., submission of an online form) and a toll-free number

Other California privacy laws (eg, the California “Shine the Light Law” and the California Online Privacy Protection Act) currently in force impose additional notice obligations, including:

Where any personal information is disclosed to a third party for their own marketing use, a specific notice about such disclosure (eg, in a company’s privacy policy) must be provided and accessible through a special link on their homepage. Further, the law gives California residents to request a list of the personal information and third parties to whom such information was disclosed for marketing purposes in the prior 12 months
Whether the company honors any do-not-track mechanisms

Under US privacy law such as the CCPA, individuals have rights to request access and deletion of their personal information and to “opt out” of sales of their personal information.&nbsp; Under the upcoming California (CPRA), Colorado (CPA) and Virginia (VCDPA) privacy laws, consumers will have additional rights, including the right to correction of their personal information and the certain rights to opt out of sales, sharing and targeted advertising.&nbsp; Further, these laws require businesses to conduct data protection or risk assessments before engaging in certain higher-risk processing activities, such as processing that relates to:

Certain unfair or intrusive profiling or targeted advertising purposes
Selling of personal data
Processing sensitive data

Virginia’s law (VCDPA) also requires businesses to establish an internal process whereby consumers may appeal a controller’s refusal to take action on a privacy request and where the appeal is denied, an online mechanism or other method by which the consumer can submit a complaint to the Colorado Attorney General
Other states impose a wide range of specific requirements, particularly in the student and employee privacy areas. For example, a significant number of states have enacted employee social media privacy laws, and, in 2014 and 2015, a disparate array of education privacy laws. In addition, there a number of sector-specific privacy laws that impose notice obligations, significantly limit permitted disclosures of personal information, and grant individuals the right to access or review records about the individual that are held by the regulated entity.
The US also regulates marketing communications extensively, including telemarketing, text message marketing, fax marketing and email marketing (which is discussed below).Last modified 24 Jan 2022
