There is no single national authority.
With some exceptions (such as for banks, credit unions and insurance companies), the FTC has jurisdiction over most commercial entities and has authority to issue and enforce federal privacy regulations (including telemarketing, email marketing, and children's privacy) and to take enforcement action to protect consumers against unfair or deceptive trade practices, including materially unfair privacy and data security practices.
Many state attorneys general have similar enforcement authority over unfair and deceptive business practices, including failure to implement reasonable security measures and violations of consumer privacy rights that harm consumers in their states.
California&nbsp;
The California Attorney General has the authority to enforce the CCPA and CPRA (once in force) and most California consumer privacy laws. Additionally, the CPRA establishes a new enforcement agency, the California Privacy Protection Agency (CPPA), vested with administrative power and authority to implement and enforce the CPRA. &nbsp;
California consumers also have a private right of action, under both the CCPA and CPRA, for certain data breaches.
Colorado
The Colorado Attorney General has the authority to enforce the CPA
Virginia
The Colorado Attorney General has the authority to enforce the VCDPA.
In addition, a wide range of sector-specific regulators, particularly those in the healthcare, financial services, telecommunications and insurance sectors, have authority to issue and enforce privacy and security regulations, with respect to entities under their jurisdiction.Last modified 24 Jan 2022
