There is no requirement to register databases or personal information processing activities. However, two states impose certain registration requirements on data brokers:
California&nbsp;
The CCPA (as amended in 2019) requires (subject to some exceptions) that data brokers register with the California Attorney General. Under the law, a "data broker" is defined as a business that knowingly collects and sells to third parties the personal information of a consumer with whom the business does not have a direct relationship. The terms "sell" and "personal information" are defined as set forth in the CCPA.
Vermont
In 2018, passed a law requiring data brokers to register with the secretary of state and adhere to minimum data security standards. Under the law a “data broker” is defined as a company that collects computerized, personal information of Vermont residents with whom the company has no direct relationship, and either sell or licenses that information.
In addition, several state laws require entities that engage in certain types of telemarketing activities to register with the state attorney general or other consumer protection agency.Last modified 24 Jan 2022
