A controller or processor may transfer personal data to another country where any of the following apply:

It has provided to the Commissioner proof of appropriate safeguards with respect to the protection of the personal data; or
The data subject has given explicit consent to the proposed transfer, after having been informed of the possible risks of the transfer owing to the absence of appropriate safeguards; or
The transfer is necessary: (i) for the performance of a contract between the data subject and the controller or the implementation of pre-contractual measures taken at the data subject’s request; (ii) for the conclusion or performance of a contract concluded in the interest of the data subject between the controller and another person; (iii) for reasons of public interest as provided by law; (iv) for the establishment, exercise or defense of a legal claim; or (v) in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of other persons, where the data subject is physically or legally incapable of giving consent; or (vi) for the purpose of compelling legitimate interests pursued by the controller or the processor which are not overridden by the interests, rights and freedoms of the data subjects involved and where – (A) the transfer is not repetitive and concerns a limited number of data subjects; and (B) the controller or processor has assessed all the circumstances surrounding the data transfer operation and has, based on such assessment, provided to the Commissioner proof of appropriate safeguards with respect to the protection of the personal data; or
The transfer is made from a register which, according to law, is intended to provide information to the public and which is open for consultation by the public or by any person who can demonstrate a legitimate interest, to the extent that the conditions laid down by law for consultation are fulfilled in the particular case. Such transfer shall not involve the entirety of the personal data or entire categories of the personal data contained in the register and, where the register is intended for consultation by persons having a legitimate interest, the transfer shall be made only at the request of those persons or in case they are to be the recipients.

The Commissioner may request a person who transfers data to another country to demonstrate the effectiveness of the safeguards or the existence of compelling legitimate interests and may, in order to protect the rights and fundamental freedoms of data subjects, prohibit, suspend or subject the transfer to such conditions as he may determine.Last modified 21 Feb 2022
