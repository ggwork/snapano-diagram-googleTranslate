The DPA 2017 provides the Commissioner with enforcement authority. Where a complaint is made to the Commissioner that the Act or any &nbsp;regulations made under it, &nbsp;has or have been, &nbsp;is or are being, or is or are about to be, contravened, the Commissioner shall:

investigate into the complaint or cause it to be investigated by an authorized officer, unless he is of the opinion that the complaint is frivolous or vexatious; and
where he is unable to arrange, within a reasonable time, for the amicable resolution by the parties concerned of the complaint, notify, in writing, the individual who made the complaint of his decision in relation to it so that the individual may, where he considers that he is aggrieved by the decision, appeal against it to the ICT Appeal Tribunal.

If the Commissioner is of the opinion that a controller or a processor has contravened, is contravening or is about to contravene the DPA 2017, the Commissioner may serve an enforcement notice on the data controller or processor, requiring remedial efforts within a specified time frame.
A person who, without reasonable excuse, fails or refuses to comply with an enforcement notice commits an offense, and, on conviction, is liable to a fine not to exceed 50,000 Mauritian rupees and to imprisonment for a term not to exceed two years.
If the Commissioner has reasonable grounds to believe that data is vulnerable to loss or modification, she may make an application to a Judge in Chambers for an order for the expeditious preservation of such data.
The Commissioner may also carry out periodical audits of the systems and security measures of data controllers or data processors to ensure compliance with data protection principles laid down in the DPA 2017.Last modified 21 Feb 2022
