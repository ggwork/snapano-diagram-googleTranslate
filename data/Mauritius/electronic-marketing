The Act regulates direct marketing, which is defined as the communication of any advertising or marketing material which is directed to any particular individual. The definition also encompasses electronic marketing.
The data subject may object to the processing of his or her personal data for purposes of direct marketing, including profiling to the extent relevant. Where a data subject objects to processing, his or her personal data may no longer be processed for that purpose. This right to object shall be explicitly brought to the attention of the data subject.Last modified 21 Feb 2022
