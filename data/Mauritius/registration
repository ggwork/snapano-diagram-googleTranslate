Every person who intends to act as a data controller or a data processor (as defined below) must register with the Commissioner in a form approved by the Commissioner and is required to pay a prescribed registration fee. The Commissioner is authorized to approve applications and issue registration certificates, which are valid for three years.
Data processors and controllers must renew their registration within three months prior to the date that their registration expires. Failure to register or renew registration constitutes an offence under the Act, punishable by a fine not exceeding 200,000 or imprisonment for a term not to exceed five years.
A data controller is a person or public body who alone, or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of personal data processing, and who has decision making power with respect to processing. A data processor is a person or public body who processes personal data on behalf of a controller.
