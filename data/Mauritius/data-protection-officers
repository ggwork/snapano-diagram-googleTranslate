The DPA 2017 provides that every controller shall adopt policies and implement appropriate technical and organizational measures so as to ensure and be able to demonstrate that the processing of personal data is performed in accordance with the Act.
One of such measures is the mandatory requirement for the designation of a data protection officer (DPO) by all controllers and processors.
There can be one DPO for a group of companies, provided he is accessible for each company within the group.
The DPO can be an employee of the Controller / Processor, provided that there is no conflict of interest (if such position leads to the determination of purposes and means of processing) such as in the case of a chief executive, chief operating, chief financial, chief medical, head of marketing, head of human resource or head of IT.
The DPO can also be someone from outside the organisation.
The DPO needs to have professional experience and knowledge of data protection laws and standards.
The Controller / Processor is required to ensure that the DPO does not receive any instructions regarding the exercise of his functions-he should work in an independent environment and manner.
Role of DPO
The role of the DPO is to:

advise the controller / processor and its employees about their obligations to comply with Data Protection Laws and monitor compliance;
train staff and conduct internal audits;
advise on DPIAs;
maintain a record of processing operations under his responsibility;
be the first point of contact for the Data Protection Office and for individuals whose data are processed (employees, customers).

DPOs are not personally responsible for non-compliance with data protection requirements. Data protection compliance is the responsibility of the controller / processor.Last modified 21 Feb 2022
