There are no EU-wide systems of registration or notification and Recital 89 of the GDPR seeks to prohibit indiscriminate general notification obligations. However, Member States may impose notification obligations for specific activities (eg, processing of personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences). The requirement to consult the supervisory authority in certain cases following a data protection impact assessment (Article 36) constitutes a notification requirement. In addition, each controller or processor must communicate the details of its data protection officer (where it is required to appoint one) to its supervisory authority (Article 37(7)).
In many ways, external accountability to supervisory authorities via registration or notification is superseded in the GDPR by rigorous demands for internal accountability. In particular, controllers and processors are required to complete and maintain comprehensive records of their data processing activities (Article 30), which must contain specific details about personal data processing carried out within an organisation and must be provided to supervisory authorities on request. This is a sizeable operational undertaking.In Denmark, the following types of processing require the DPA’s preapproval:

private data controllers’ processing of personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, and the processing of genetic data, biometric data for uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or data concerning a natural person's sex life or sexual orientation (‘Special Categories of Personal Data’), solely in the public’s interest
disclosure of personal data as mentioned in Articles 9(1) and 10 of the GDPR, originally processed for the sole purpose of carrying out scientific or statistic studies, if i) such data is to be processed outside the geographical scope of the GDPR, ii) the data constitutes biological material or iii) if the data is to be published in a recognised scientific journal or similar
processing personal data in a register on behalf of a private data controller:

solely for the purpose of warning other businesses from engaging in business with or employing a natural person
with the intention of commercial exploitation of data on the natural person’s creditworthiness and financial solidity, or
for the creation of a register on judicial information
