Transfers of personal data by a controller or a processor to third countries outside of the EU (and Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland) are only permitted where the conditions laid down in the GDPR are met (Article 44).
The European Commission has the power to make an adequacy decision in respect of a third country, determining that it provides for an adequate level of data protection, and therefore personal data may be freely transferred to that country (Article 45(1)). Currently, the following countries or territories enjoy adequacy decisions: Andorra, Argentina, Canada (with some exceptions), Switzerland, Faroe Islands, Guernsey, Israel, Isle of Man, Jersey, Eastern Republic of Uruguay and New Zealand.
Transfers to third countries are also permitted where appropriate safeguards have been provided by the controller or processor and on condition that enforceable data subject rights and effective legal remedies for the data subject are available. The list of appropriate safeguards includes amongst others binding corporate rules, standard contractual clauses, and the EU-US Privacy Shield Framework. The GDPR has removed the need which existed in some Member States under the previous law to notify and in some cases seek prior approval of standard contractual clauses from supervisory authorities.
The GDPR also includes a list of context specific derogations, permitting transfers to third countries where:

explicit informed consent has been obtained;
the transfer is necessary for the performance of a contract or the implementation of pre-contractual measures;
the transfer is necessary for the conclusion or performance of a contract concluded in the interests of the data subject between the controller and another natural or legal person;
the transfer is necessary for important reasons of public interest;
the transfer is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims;
the transfer is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject where consent cannot be obtained; or
the transfer is made from a register which according to EU or Member State law is intended to provide information to the public, subject to certain conditions.

There is also a very limited derogation to transfer where no other mechanism is available and the transfer is necessary for the purposes of compelling legitimate interests of the controller which are not overridden by the interests and rights of the data subject; notification to the supervisory authority and the data subject is required if relying on this derogation.
Transfers demanded by courts, tribunals or administrative authorities of countries outside the EU (Article 48) are only recognised or enforceable (within the EU) where they are based on an international agreement such as a mutual legal assistance treaty in force between the requesting third country and the EU or Member State; a transfer in response to such requests where there is no other legal basis for transfer will infringe the GDPR.The Danish&nbsp;Data Protection&nbsp;Act does not regulate transfer of personal data. Thus, the article of the GDPR applies, under which data controllers may transfer all types of personal data to a third country or an international organization out of the EU/EEA if any of the following conditions are met:

the EU Commission has established that the third-country/area or one or more specific sectors in the third country, or the international organization has adequate safeguards with respect to the protection of the rights of the data subject
the controller or processor has provided appropriate safeguards, on the condition that enforceable data subject rights and effective legal remedies for data subjects are available (such as through binding corporate rules – approved by the DPA)
the data controller or data processor and the international organization enter into the standard terms approved by the EU Commission

If no&nbsp;approval has been obtained on the third country’s adequate safeguards and no appropriate safeguards have been provided including binding corporate rules, personal data can be transferred to a third country or an international organization if one of the following criteria are met:

the data subject has given his explicit consent
the transfer is necessary for the performance of a contract between the data subject and the controller or the implementation of pre-contractual measures taken in response to the data subject’s request
the transfer is necessary for the conclusion or performance of a contract concluded in the interest of the data subject between the controller and a third party
the transfer is necessary or legally required on important public interest grounds
the transfer is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims
the transfer is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or other natural person, where the person concerned is physically or legally incapable of giving his or her consent
the transfer is made from a register which according to law or regulations is open to consultation either by the public in general or by any person who can demonstrate legitimate interests, to the extent that the conditions laid down in law for consultation are fulfilled in the particular case
