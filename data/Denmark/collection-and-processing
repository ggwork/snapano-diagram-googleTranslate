Data Protection Principles
Controllers are responsible for compliance with a set of core principles which apply to all processing of personal data. Under these principles, personal data must be (Article 5):

processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner (the "lawfulness, fairness and transparency principle");
collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes (the "purpose limitation principle");
adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purpose(s) (the "data minimization principle");
accurate and where necessary kept up-to-date (the "accuracy principle");
kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purpose(s) for which the data are processed (the "storage limitation principle"); and
processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, using appropriate technical and organizational measures (the "integrity and confidentiality principle").

The controller is responsible for and must be able to demonstrate compliance with the above principles (the "accountability principle"). Accountability is a core theme of the GDPR. Organizations must not only comply with the GDPR but also be able to demonstrate compliance perhaps years after a particular decision relating to processing personal data was taken. Record-keeping, audit and appropriate governance will all form a key role in achieving accountability.
Legal Basis under Article 6
In addition, in order to satisfy the lawfulness principle, each use of personal data must be justified by reference to an appropriate basis for processing. The legal bases (also known lawful bases or lawful grounds) under which personal data may be processed are (Article 6(1)):

with the consent of the data subject (where consent must be "freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous", and must be capable of being withdrawn at any time);
where necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party, or to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract;
where necessary to comply with a legal obligation (of the EU) to which the controller is subject;
where necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or another person (generally recognized as being limited to 'life or death' scenarios, such as medical emergencies);
where necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest, or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller; or
where necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests of the controller or a third party (which is subject to a balancing test, in which the interests of the controller must not override the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject. Note also that this basis cannot be relied upon by a public authority in the performance of its tasks).

Special Category Data
Processing of special category data is prohibited (Article 9), except where one of the following exemptions applies (which, in effect, operate as secondary bases which must be established for the lawful processing of special category data, in addition to an Article 6 basis):

with the explicit consent of the data subject;
where necessary for the purposes of carrying out obligations and exercising rights under employment, social security and social protection law or a collective agreement;
where necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or another natural person who is physically or legally incapable of giving consent;
in limited circumstances by certain not-for-profit bodies;
where processing relates to the personal data which are manifestly made public by the data subject;
where processing is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims or where courts are acting in their legal capacity;
where necessary for reasons of substantial public interest on the basis of Union or Member State law, proportionate to the aim pursued and with appropriate safeguards;
where necessary for preventative or occupational medicine, for assessing the working capacity of the employee, medical diagnosis, provision of health or social care or treatment of the management of health or social care systems and services;
where necessary for reasons of public interest in the area of public health, such as protecting against serious cross-border threats to health or ensuring high standards of health care and of medical products and devices; or
where necessary for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes in accordance with restrictions set out in Article 89(1).

Member States are permitted to introduce domestic laws including further conditions and limitations for processing with regard to processing genetic data, biometric data and health data.
Criminal Convictions and Offences data
Processing of personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences is prohibited unless carried out under the control of an official public authority, or specifically authorized by Member State domestic law (Article 10).
Processing for a Secondary Purpose
Increasingly, organizations wish to 're-purpose' personal data -&nbsp;ie, use data collected for one purpose for a new purpose which was not disclosed to the data subject at the time the data were first collected. This is potentially in conflict with the core principle of purpose limitation; to ensure that the rights of data subjects are protected. The GDPR sets out a series of factors that the controller must consider to ascertain whether the new process is compatible with the purposes for which the personal data were initially collected (Article 6(4)). These include:

any link between the original purpose and the new purpose
the context in which the data have been collected
the nature of the personal data, in particular whether special categories of data or data relating to criminal convictions are processed (with the inference being that if they are it will be much harder to form the view that a new purpose is compatible)
the possible consequences of the new processing for the data subjects
the existence of appropriate safeguards, which may include encryption or pseudonymization.

If the controller concludes that the new purpose is incompatible with the original purpose, then the only bases to justify the new purpose are consent or a legal obligation (more specifically an EU or Member State law which constitutes a necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic society).
Transparency (Privacy Notices)
The GDPR places considerable emphasis on transparency,&nbsp;ie, the right for a data subject to understand how and why his or her data are used, and what other rights are available to data subjects to control processing. The presentation of granular, yet easily accessible, privacy notices should, therefore, be seen as a cornerstone of GDPR compliance.
Various information must be provided by controllers to data subjects in a concise, transparent and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language (Article 12(1)).
The following information must be provided (Article 13) at the time the data are obtained:

the identity and contact details of the controller;
the data protection officer's contact details (if there is one);
both the purpose for which data will be processed and the legal basis for processing, including, if relevant, the legitimate interests for processing;
the recipients or categories of recipients of the personal data;
details of international transfers;
the period for which personal data will be stored or, if that is not possible, the criteria used to determine this;
the existence of rights of the data subject including the right to access, rectify, require erasure, restrict processing, object to processing and data portability;
where applicable, the right to withdraw consent, and the right to complain to supervisory authorities;
the consequences of failing to provide data necessary to enter into a contract;
the existence of any automated decision making and profiling and the consequences for the data subject; and
in addition, where a controller wishes to process existing data for a new purpose, they must inform data subjects of that further processing, providing the above information.

Somewhat different requirements apply (Article 14) where information has not been obtained from the data subject.
Rights of the Data Subject
Data subjects enjoy a range of rights to control the processing of their personal data, some of which are very broadly applicable, while others only apply in quite limited circumstances. Controllers must provide information on action taken in response to requests within one calendar month as a default, with a limited right for the controller to extend this period thereby a further two months where the request is onerous.
Right of access (Article 15)
A data subject is entitled to request access to and obtain a copy of his or her personal data, together with prescribed information about the how the data have been used by the controller.
Right to rectify (Article 16)
Data subjects may require inaccurate or incomplete personal data to be corrected or completed without undue delay.
Right to erasure ('right to be forgotten') (Article 17)
Data subjects may request erasure of their personal data. The forerunner of this right made headlines in 2014 when Europe’s highest court ruled against Google (Judgment of the CJEU in Case C-131/12), in effect requiring Google to remove search results relating to historic proceedings against a Spanish national for an unpaid debt on the basis that Google as a data controller of the search results had no legal basis to process that information.
The right is not absolute; it only arises in quite a narrow set of circumstances, notably where the controller no longer needs the data for the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise lawfully processed, or as a corollary of the successful exercise of the objection right, or of the withdrawal of consent.
Right to restriction of processing (Article 18)
Data subjects enjoy a right to restrict processing of their personal data in defined circumstances. These include where the accuracy of the data is contested; where the processing is unlawful; where the data are no longer needed save for legal claims of the data subject, or where the legitimate grounds for processing by the controller are contested.
Right to data portability (Article 20)
Where the processing of personal data is justified either on the basis that the data subject has given his or her consent to processing or where processing is necessary for the performance of a contract, then the data subject has the right to receive or have transmitted to another controller all personal data concerning him or her in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format (eg, commonly used file formats recognized by mainstream software applications, such as .xsl).
Right to object (Article 21)
Data subjects have the right to object to processing on the legal basis of the legitimate interests of the data controller or where processing is in the public interest. Controllers will then have to suspend processing of the data until such time as they demonstrate “compelling legitimate grounds” for processing which override the rights of the data subject.
In addition, data subjects enjoy an unconditional right to object to the processing of personal data for direct marketing purposes at any time.
The right not to be subject to automated decision making, including profiling (Article 22)
Automated decision making (including profiling) "which produces legal effects concerning [the data subject] … or similarly significantly affects him or her" is only permitted where:

necessary for entering into or performing a contract;
authorized by EU or Member State law; or
the data subject has given their explicit (ie, opt-in) consent.

Further, where significant automated decisions are taken on the basis of grounds (a) or (c), the data subject has the right to obtain human intervention, to contest the decision, and to express his or her point of view.The GDPR differentiates between 1) Personal data, 2) Special Categories of Personal Data, 3) Data on criminal offences and 4) National identification numbers (CPR numbers). See below.
1. Personal data
Under the GDPR, data controllers may legally register and process personal data (all data except the Special Categories of Personal Data, Data on criminal offences and national identification numbers) only when at least one of the following conditions is met:

the data subject has given his explicit consent in accordance with article 7 and 8 (children’s consent) of the GDPR
processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract
processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject
processing is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or any other natural person
processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or for the performance of a task carried out in the exercise of official authority vested in the data controller, or
processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the data controller or by the third-party to whom the data is disclosed, unless these interests are overridden by either the data subject’s fundamental rights including its civil rights or other interests of the data subject

2. Special Categories of Personal Data
Special Categories of Personal Data (as detailed under 'Registration') may be processed only when at least one of the following conditions is met:

the data subject has given his explicit consent to the processing of such data for one or several purposes
processing is necessary for the purposes of carrying out the obligations and exercising specific rights of the data controller or of the data subject in the field of employment law
processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person where the person concerned is physically or legally incapable of giving his or her consent
processing is carried out in the course of its legitimate activities with appropriate safeguards by a foundation, association or any other not-for-profit body with a political, philosophical, religious or trade union aim and on condition that the processing relates solely to the members or to former members of the body or to persons who have regular contact with it in connection with its purposes and that the personal data are not disclosed outside that body without the consent of the data subjects
processing relates to personal data which are manifestly made public by the data subject
processing is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims or whenever courts are acting in their judicial capacity
the processing is necessary for the purposes of preventive medicine, medical diagnosis, the provision of care or treatment, or the management of medical and health care services, and where those data are processed by a health professional subject under law to the obligation of professional secrecy
processing is necessary for reasons of substantial public interest. The DPA must approve the processing unless such is carried out by a public organization.

Personal data and Special Categories of Personal Data may be processed, if such process is carried out in relation to the data subject’s employment at the data controller, if such process is necessary for the data controller to comply with employment-related obligations or rights under applicable law or collective agreements, or if the process is necessary for the data controller or third-party’s possibility to pursue legitimate interests originating from other legislation or collective agreements as long as the civil rights and interests of the data subject precedes.
Furthermore, personal data may be processed where the processing takes place for the sole purpose of carrying out statistical or scientific studies of significant importance to society and where such processing is necessary in order to carry out these studies. Sharing of personal data for such purposes will, however, be subject to the conditions set forth in the Danish Ministerial Order no. 1509 of 18 December 2019, according to which personal data shared for the purpose of carrying out statistical or scientific studies must, amongst other, be pseudonymised before sharing, unless direct identifications is strictly necessary.
3. Data relating to criminal convictions and offences
Data relating to criminal convictions and offences may be processed by public data controllers only if the processing is strictly necessary for the performance of regulatory and public tasks. No such data can, however, be disclosed, unless at least any of the following conditions are met:


the data subject has given explicit consent to such disclosure


disclosure takes place for the purpose of safeguarding private or public interests which clearly override the interests of secrecy, including the interests of the person to whom the data relate


disclosure is necessary for the performance of the activities of an authority or required for a decision to be made by that authority; or


disclosure is necessary for the performance of tasks for a public authority by a person or an enterprise


Private data controllers may process data relating to criminal convictions and offences, if the data subject in question has given his or her explicit consent in accordance with article 7 of the GDPR, or if the processing is strictly necessary to carry out interests significantly exceeding the interests of the data subject. None of the data may be disclosed without the explicit consent of the data subject, unless such disclosure takes place for the purpose of safeguarding public or private interests, including the interests of the person concerned, which clearly override the interests of secrecy.
Both public and private actors may process data relating to criminal convictions and offences if at least one the following conditions is met:

processing is necessary for the purpose of carrying out the obligations and exercising specific rights of the data controller or of the data subject in the field of employment law
processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person where the person concerned is physically or legally incapable of giving his or her consent
processing is carried out in the course of its legitimate activities with appropriate safeguards by a foundation, association or any other not-for-profit body with a political, philosophical, religious or trade union aim and on condition that the processing relates solely to the members or to former members of the body or to persons who have regular contact with it in connection with its purposes and that the personal data are not disclosed outside that body without the consent of the data subjects
processing relates to personal data which are manifestly made public by the data subject
processing is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims or whenever courts are acting in their judicial capacity
the processing is necessary for the purposes of preventive medicine, medical diagnosis, the provision of care or treatment, or the management of medical and health care services, and where those data are processed by a health professional subject under law to the obligation of professional secrecy, or
processing is necessary for reasons of substantial public interest. The DPA must approve the processing unless such is carried out by the public organization.

4. National identification numbers
National identification numbers (in Danish ‘CPR-nummer.’) may be processed by public organizations for the purpose of identification or as reference number.
Private data controllers may process CPR-nummer when at least one of the following conditions are met:

the process is required under statutory law
the data subject concerned has given his or her explicit consent in accordance with article 7 of the GDPR
the processing is carried out for scientific or statistic purposes (however not for publication which requires a specific consent)
the CPR-nummer disclosed as part of the company’s natural operations and such disclosure is of significant importance to the company to ensure identification of the data subject in question or requested by a public authority
processing is necessary for the purposes of carrying out the obligations and exercising specific rights of the data controller or of the data subject in the field of employment law
processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person where the person concerned is physically or legally incapable of giving his or her consent
processing is carried out in the course of its legitimate activities with appropriate safeguards by a foundation, association or any other not-for-profit body with a political, philosophical, religious or trade union aim and on condition that the processing relates solely to the members or to former members of the body or to persons who have regular contact with it in connection with its purposes and that the personal data are not disclosed outside that body without the consent of the data subjects
processing relates to personal data which are manifestly made public by the data subject
processing is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims or whenever courts are acting in their judicial capacity
the processing is necessary for the purposes of preventive medicine, medical diagnosis, the provision of care or treatment, or the management of medical and health care services, and where those data are processed by a health professional subject under law to the obligation of professional secrecy, or
processing is necessary for reasons of substantial public interest. The DPA must approve the processing unless it is carried out by a public data controller

5. Transparency requirements
The data controller must, at the time when personal data are obtained (no later than within one month after), provide the data subject with the necessary information to fulfil the duty of information, including information about:

the identity of the data controller, his representative and the DPO (if applicable)
the contact details of the data controller/the representative
the categories of data concerned
the purposes of the processing for which the data is intended as well as the legal basis for the processing
the legitimate interests pursued by the data controller, where the processing is based on article 6(1)(f) of GDPR
the recipients or categories of recipients of the personal data, (if any)
(where applicable), information of transfer of data to third countries or international organizations or the intention hereof, as well as reference to the appropriate and suitable safeguards in connection with such transfers
The period for which the data will be stored
The data subject’s right to withdraw a consent at any time
The data subject’s rights, including to lodge a complaint, deletion, insight and correction
From which source the personal data originate (if applicable), and whether it came from publicly accessible sources (if applicable)
The existence of automated decision making (if applicable)

Under the Danish Data Protection Act the above-mentioned obligation does not apply if interests of the public, other people, or the data subject itself, exceeds the data subject’s interest in obtaining the information.
