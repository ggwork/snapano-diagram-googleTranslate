Registration and fees are governed by the &nbsp;Data Protection (Registration and Charges) (Jersey) Regulations&nbsp;2018 (as amended) (the "Regulations") under which &nbsp;annual processing fees are charged, the value of which are based on:

the number of full-time employees;
the level of past-year revenue;
whether the relevant entity is a regulated financial services provider (or otherwise subject to the Money Laundering (Jersey) Order 2008);
if the entity processes special category data; and
if the entity is administered by a trust company business or fund services business, and if so, the name of the administrator.&nbsp;

The maximum fee payable on the basis of the above is £1,600. However, the majority of data controllers and processors pay £70.
Entities that are administered by a regulated trust company business or fund services business are required to pay a fixed annual charge of £50. No fees are payable where the entity does not process data (as they would not be considered data controllers or processors).
All controllers and processors are required to renew their registration annually.&nbsp;It should be noted that, external accountability to the Information Commissioner via registration or notification has in many ways superseded in the DPAJL and DPJL by rigorous demands for internal accountability.&nbsp;
In particular, controllers and processors are required to complete and maintain comprehensive records of their data processing activities (Article 14(3) DPJL), which must contain specific details about personal data processing carried out within an organization and must be provided to supervisory authorities on request.Last modified 21 Feb 2022
