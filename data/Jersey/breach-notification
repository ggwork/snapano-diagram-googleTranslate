The DPJL includes obligations related to ‘personal data breaches’, which are defined in the DPJL as breaches of security leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to, personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed.
Data controllers must notify the Information Commissioner via an online portal (https://oicjersey.org/breach-reporting/) that a personal data breach has occurred within 72 hours of becoming aware of the breach (Article 20 DPJL). A breach does not need to be notified to the Information Commissioner where it is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons in respect of their personal data. If there is a high risk that the personal data breach is likely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the data controller must also notify those individuals.
Controllers are also required to keep a record of all data breaches (Article 20(5) DPJL) (whether or not notified to the Information Commissioner) and permit audits of the record by the Information Commissioner.Last modified 21 Feb 2022
