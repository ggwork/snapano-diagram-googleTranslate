The DPJL defines 'data' as information that:

Is processed by means of equipment operating automatically in response to instructions given for that purpose or is recorded with the intention that it should be processed by means of such equipment
Is recorded as part of a filing system or with the intention that it should form part of a filing system, or
Is recorded information held by certain public authorities

The DPJL defines 'personal data' as being any data relating to a data subject.
A 'data subject' is defined in the DPJL as an identified or identifiable, natural living person who can be identified, directly or indirectly, by reference to (but not limited to) an identifier such as:

A name, an identification number or location data
An online identifier (which may include an IP address, location data or any unique number or code issued to the individual by a public authority), or
One or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of the person

Enhanced levels of protection in the DPJL and DPAJL are provided for 'special category' personal data.
'Special category personal data' is defined under the DPJL as personal :

Data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs or trade union membership
Genetic or biometric data that is processed for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person
Data concerning health
Data concerning a natural person’s sex life or sexual orientation, or
Data relating to a natural person’s criminal record or alleged criminal activity

Personal data may be processed by either a 'controller' or a 'processor'. The controller is the decision maker, the person who "alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data" (Article 1(1) DPJL). The processor "processes personal data on behalf of the controller", acting on the instructions of the controller. In contrast to the previous law, the DPJL imposes direct obligations on both the controller and the processor, although fewer obligations are imposed on the processor.Last modified 21 Feb 2022
