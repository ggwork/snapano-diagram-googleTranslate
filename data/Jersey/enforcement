In Jersey, the Authority is responsible for the enforcement of the DPJL and DPAJL. Its day-to-day powers are delegated to the Information Commissioner, with the exception of the issuing of public statements and imposing fines.
The Authority has wide powers to require information and to enter and search premises (Schedule 1 DPAJL). It may also conduct and/or require an audit of a controller or processor.
The Information Commissioner may take the following enforcement actions:
Reprimand
The DPAJL does not specify the conditions upon which a reprimand may be issued; however most will likely take the form of a notice, and may be issued in combination with an administrative fine or a formal undertaking by the controller or processor to meet future compliance with any part of the DPJL or DPAJL.
Warning
This sanction applies where it appears to the Information Commissioner that the intended processing or other act or omission is likely to contravene the DPJL or DPAJL. Such warnings may be issued by way of a formal notice in advance of any intended processing.
Order
This refers to a formal notice of enforcement and can order any or all of the following:

Bring specified processing operations into compliance with the DPAJL or DPJL, or take any other specified action required to comply with the same, in a manner and within a period specified in the order
Notify a data subject of a personal data breach
Comply with a request made by the data subject to exercise a data subject right
Rectify or erase personal data
Restrict or limit the recipient’s processing operations, and
Notify persons to whom the personal data has been disclosed of the rectification, erasure or temporary restriction on processing

Administrative Fines
The DPAJL also empowers the Authority to impose administrative fines (Article 26 DPAJL), which may be imposed in addition to any other sanctions.
An administrative fine must not exceed £300,000 or 10% of the person’s total global annual turnover or total gross income in the preceding financial year, whichever is the higher (Article 27(2) DPAJL).
An administrative fine ordered against any person whose processing of data that gave rise to the fine was in the public interest and not for profit must not exceed £10,000 (Article 27(3) DPAJL).
Subject to the above limits, an administrative fine of up to £5 million may be ordered for:

Failure to make reasonable efforts to verify that a person giving consent to the processing of the personal data of a child as required by Article&nbsp;11(4) of the DPJL (information society services) is a person duly authorized to give consent to that processing
Breach of Article 7 of the DPJL (obligations of joint controllers)
Breach of Part 3 of the DPJL (which includes record-keeping obligations, data protection by design and default, data protection impact assessments, appointment conditions for data processors and breach notification)
Breach of Part 4 of the DPJL (which includes information security obligations and general obligations on processors), and
Breach of Part 5 of the DPJL (which includes obligations relating to data protection officers)

An administrative fine of up to £10 million may be imposed for:

Breach of Part 2 of the DPJL (which includes fundamental duties of controllers, including compliance with the data protection principles, data subject information provisions and rules regarding consent) other than for Articles 7 and 11(4), and
Breach of Part 6 of the DPJL (Data Subject Rights)

Right to claim compensation
The DPJL makes specific provision for individuals to bring private claims against controllers and processors.
Where a controller has breached the transparency and data subject rights provisions of the DPJL, a data subject may ask the Royal Court to make such order as it considers appropriate, which may include:

An award of compensation for loss, damage or distress in respect of the violation
An injunction (including an interim injunction) to restrain any actual or anticipated violation
A declaration that the controller is responsible for the violation or that a particular act, omission or course of conduct on the part of the controller would result in a violation, and
Requiring the controller to give effect to the transparency and data subject rights provisions (unless, in the case of a data subject access request, the Royal Court is satisfied that complying with the request will cause serious harm to a third party's physical or mental health)

Any person who has suffered "loss, damage or distress" as a result of a breach of the DPJL has the right to receive compensation (Article 69 DPJL) from the controller or processor. This means that individuals will be able to claim compensation for distress even where they are not able to prove financial loss. In addition, data subjects have the right to mandate a consumer protection body to exercise rights and bring claims on their behalf (Article 70). Individuals also enjoy the right to lodge a complaint with the Information Commissioner in relation to any violation of the DPJL that affects him or her (Article 19 DPAJL). Last, all natural and legal persons, including individuals, controllers and processors, have the right to complain to the Royal Court about a decision, or failure to make a decision, of the Authority or Information Commissioner concerning him or her.
Offenses
The DPJL contains the following offenses:

Unlawfully obtaining personal data (Article 71 DPJL)
Requiring a person to produce certain records (Article 72 DPJL)
Providing false information (Article 73 DPJL), and
Obstruction (Article 74 DPJL)

The DPAJL contains the following offenses:

Failing to register with the Authority as a controller or processors (Art.17(6) DPAJL), and
Failing to comply with an order made by the Authority following a breach determination (Article 25(8) DPAJL)

If a company or other organization commits a criminal offense under the DPJL or DPAJL, any partner, director, manager, secretary or similar officer or someone purporting to act in such capacity is personally guilty of an offense in addition to the corporate body if:

The offense was committed with his or her consent or connivance, or
The offense is attributable to any neglect on his or her part
