The Data Protection (Jersey) Law, 2018 (DPJL) and the Data Protection Authority (Jersey) Law, 2018 (DPAJL) came into force on May 25, 2018. These laws superseded the Data Protection (Jersey) Law 2005, which had been held to be adequate by the European Commission for the purposes of the European Data Protection Directive (Directive 95/46/EC) (see Commission Decision 2008/393/EC). This decision continues to apply pending a review of Jersey's adequacy (to be conducted under Article 45 of the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)), the outcome of which was expected in 2021 but is now expected in early 2022.
The DPJL and DPAJL provide a broadly equivalent regime to that under the GDPR.Last modified 21 Feb 2022
