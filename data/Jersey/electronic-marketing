The DPJL applies to most electronic marketing activities, as they involve some use of personal data (eg, an email address that includes the recipient's name). The most plausible legal bases for electronic marketing will be consent, or the legitimate interests of the controller. &nbsp;
Where consent is relied upon, the strict standards for consent under the DPJL apply, and marketing consent forms will invariably need to incorporate clearly worded opt-in mechanisms (such as the checking of an unchecked consent box, or the signing of a statement, and&nbsp;not&nbsp;merely the acceptance of terms and conditions, or consent implied from conduct, such as visiting a website).
Data subjects have an unconditional right to object to (and therefore prevent) any form of direct marketing (including electronic marketing) at any time (Article 36 DPJL).Last modified 21 Feb 2022
