Data controllers and processors are required (Article 24 DPJL) to appoint a data protection officer if:

Processing is carried out by a public authority (with the exception of courts acting in their judicial capacity)
The core activities of the controller or the processor consist of processing operations that, by virtue of their nature, scope or purposes, require regular and systematic monitoring of data subjects on a large scale
The core activities of the controller or the processor consist of processing special category data on a large scale, or
It is otherwise required by law

Groups of undertakings are permitted to appoint a single data protection officer with responsibility for multiple legal entities (Article 24(3) DPJL). However, larger corporate groups may find it difficult in practice to operate with a single data protection officer. The data protection officer must be easily accessible to:

All data subjects
The Information Commissioner, and
The controller or processor who appointed the officer, along with the controller’s or processor’s employees that carry out data processing

Data protection officers (DPOs) must have expert knowledge (Article 24(6) DPJL) of data protection law and practices, though it is possible to outsource the DPO role to a service provider (Article 24(7) DPJL).
Controllers and processors are required to ensure that the DPO is involved "properly and in a timely manner in all issues which relate to the protection of personal data" (Article 25(1) DPJL), and the DPO must directly report to the highest management level of the controller or processor (Article 25(2) DPJL).
In addition, controllers and processers must:

Ensure that the data protection officer operates independently and does not receive any instructions regarding the performance of those duties, other than to perform them to the best of the officer’s ability and in a professional and competent manner (Article 25(1)(c) DPJL), and
Not dismiss or penalize the data protection officer for performing his or her duties other than for failing to perform them to the best of the officer's ability and in a professional and competent manner (Article 25(1)(d) DPJL)

The specific tasks of the DPO are set out in Article 26 DPJL and include:

Informing and advising on compliance with the DPJL, DPAJL and other applicable data protection laws
Monitoring compliance with the law and with the internal policies of the organization, including assigning responsibilities, raising awareness and training staff
Advising on and monitoring data protection impact assessments, where requested, and
Cooperating and acting as point of contact with the Information Commissioner
