The Data Protection Act, 2011 (DPA) provides for the protection of personal privacy and information processed and collected by public bodies and private organizations.
The DPA was partially enacted on January 6, 2012 by Legal Notice 2 of 2012, and only Part I and sections 7 to 18, 22, 23, 25(1), 26 and 28 of Part II have come into operation.
No timetable has been set for enacting the remainder of the DPA, and it is possible that there may be changes to the remainder of the legislation before it is proclaimed.Last modified 24 Jan 2022
