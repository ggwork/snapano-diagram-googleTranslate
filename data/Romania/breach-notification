The GDPR contains a general requirement for a personal data breach to be notified by the controller to its supervisory authority, and for more serious breaches to also be notified to affected data subjects. A personal data breach is a wide concept, defined as any "breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to, personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed."
The controller must notify a breach to the supervisory authority without undue delay, and where feasible, not later than 72 hours after having become aware of it, unless the controller determines that the breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons. When the personal data breach is likely to result in a high risk to natural persons, the controller is also required to notify the affected data subjects without undue delay.&nbsp;
Where the breach occurs at the level of the processor, it is required to notify the controller without undue delay upon becoming aware of the breach.
The notification to the supervisory authority must include where possible:

The categories and approximate numbers of individuals and records concerned
The name of the organisationâ€™s data protection officer or other contact
The likely consequences of the breach and the measures taken to mitigate harm&nbsp;

Controllers are also required to keep a record of all data breaches (whether or not notified to the supervisory authority) and permit audits of the record by the supervisory authority.
No specific provisions / derogations are provided by the Law no. 190/2018 with respect to the notification of a personal data security breach. However, where data controllers notify a personal data breach to ANSPDCP, a special notification form must be filled out and submitted.Last modified 17 Jan 2022
