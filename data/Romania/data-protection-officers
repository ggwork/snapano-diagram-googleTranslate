Each controller or processor is required to appoint a data protection officer (DPO) if it satisfies one or more of the following tests:

It is a public authority
Its core activities consist of processing operations which, by virtue of their nature, scope or purposes, require regular and systemic monitoring of data subjects on a large scale
Its core activities consist of processing sensitive personal data on a large scale

Groups of undertakings are permitted to appoint a single data protection officer with responsibility for multiple legal entities, provided that the data protection officer is easily accessible from each establishment (meaning that larger corporate groups may find it difficult in practice to operate with a single data protection officer).
DPOs must have expert knowledge&nbsp;of data protection law and practices, though it is possible to outsource the DPO role to a service provider.
Controllers and processors are required to ensure that the DPO is involved "properly and in a timely manner in all issues which relate to the protection of personal data," and the DPO must directly report to the highest management level, must not be told what to do in the exercise of his or her tasks and must not be dismissed or penalised for performing those tasks.
The specific tasks of the DPO, set out in GDPR, include:

To inform and advise on compliance with GDPR and other Union and Member State data protection laws
To monitor compliance with the law and with the internal policies of the organization including assigning responsibilities, awareness raising and training staff
To advise and monitor data protection impact assessments where requested
To cooperate and act as point of contact with the supervisory authority

This is a good example of an area of the GDPR where Member State gold plating laws are likely. For example, German domestic law has set the bar for the appointment of DPOs considerably lower than that set out in the GDPR.
In addition to the requirements provided by the GDPR in Articles 37 to 39,&nbsp;Law no. 190/2018&nbsp;provides that a data protection officer (DPO) must be designated whenever the entity acting as controller is processing a national identification number, including by collecting or disclosing any documents enclosing such national identification number, when the processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, in accordance with the provisions of Article 6 paragraph 1 letter (f) of the GDPR.Last modified 17 Jan 2022
