The GDPR does not prescribe specific technical standards or measures. Rather, the GDPR adopts a proportionate, context-specific approach to security. Article 32 states that controllers and processors shall implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk of the processing. In so doing, they must take account of the state of the art, the costs of implementation, and the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing. A one-size-fits-all approach is therefore the antithesis of this requirement.
However, the GDPR does require controllers and processors to consider the following when assessing what might constitute adequate security:

The pseudonymization and encryption of personal data
The ability to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of processing systems and services
The ability to restore the availability and access to personal data in a timely manner in the event of a physical or technical incident
A process for regularly testing, assessing and evaluating the effectiveness of technical and organizational measures for ensuring the security of the processing

No specific provisions / derogations are provided by Law no. 190/2018&nbsp;with respect to the security measures to be undertaken by controllers / processors.Last modified 17 Jan 2022
