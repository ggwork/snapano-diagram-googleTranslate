Data Protection Principles
Controllers are responsible for compliance with a set of core principles which apply to all processing of personal data. Under these principles, personal data must be:

Processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner (the "lawfulness, fairness and transparency principle")
Collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes (the "purpose limitation principle")
Adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purpose(s) (the "data minimization principle");
Accurate and where necessary kept up to date (the "accuracy principle")
Kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purpose(s) for which the data are processed (the "storage limitation principle")
Processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, using appropriate technical and organizational measures (the "integrity and confidentiality principle")

The controller is responsible for and must be able to demonstrate compliance with the above principles (the "accountability principle"). Accountability is a core theme of the GDPR. Organizations must not only comply with the GDPR but also be able to demonstrate compliance for potentially years after a particular decision relating to processing personal data was rendered. Record-keeping, auditing and appropriate governance will all play a key role in achieving accountability.
Legal Basis under Article 6
In addition, in order to satisfy the lawfulness principle, each use of personal data must be justified by reference to an appropriate basis for processing. The legal bases (also known lawful bases or lawful grounds) under which personal data may be processed are (Article 6(1)):

With the consent of the data subject (where consent must be "freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous," and must be capable of being withdrawn at any time)
Where necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party, or to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract
Where necessary to comply with a legal obligation (of the EU) to which the controller is subject
Where necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or another person (generally recognised as being limited to 'life or death' scenarios, such as medical emergencies)
Where necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest, or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller
Where necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests of the controller or a third party (which is subject to a balancing test, in which the interests of the controller must not override the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject. Note also that this basis cannot be relied upon by a public authority in the performance of its tasks)

Special Category Data
Processing of special category data is prohibited, except where one of the following exemptions applies (which, in effect, operate as secondary bases which must be established for the lawful processing of special category data, in addition to an Article 6 basis):

With the explicit consent of the data subject
Where necessary for the purposes of carrying out obligations and exercising rights under employment, social security and social protection law or a collective agreement
Where necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or another natural person who is physically or legally incapable of giving consent
In limited circumstances by certain not-for-profit bodies
Where processing relates to the personal data which are manifestly made public by the data subject
Where processing is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims or where courts are acting in their legal capacity
Where necessary for reasons of substantial public interest on the basis of Union or Member State law, proportionate to the aim pursued and with appropriate safeguards
Where necessary for preventative or occupational medicine, for assessing the working capacity of the employee, medical diagnosis, provision of health or social care or treatment of the management of health or social care systems and services
Where necessary for reasons of public interest in the area of public health, such as protecting against serious cross-border threats to health or ensuring high standards of health care and of medical products and devices
Where necessary for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes in accordance with restrictions set out in Article 89(1)

Member States are permitted to introduce domestic laws including further conditions and limitations for processing with regard to processing genetic data, biometric data and health data.
Criminal Convictions and Offences data
Processing of personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences is prohibited unless carried out under the control of an official public authority, or specifically authorized by Member State domestic law.&nbsp;
Processing for a Secondary Purpose
Increasingly, organisations wish to re-purpose personal data - ie,&nbsp;use data collected for one purpose for a new purpose which was not disclosed to the data subject at the time the data were first collected. This is potentially in conflict with the core principle of purpose limitation; to ensure that the rights of data subjects are protected. The GDPR sets out a series of factors that the controller must consider to ascertain whether the new process is compatible with the purposes for which the personal data were initially collected. These include:

Any link between the original purpose and the new purpose
The context in which the data have been collected
The nature of the personal data, in particular whether special categories of data or data relating to criminal convictions are processed (with the inference being that if they are it will be much harder to form the view that a new purpose is compatible)
The possible consequences of the new processing for the data subjects
The existence of appropriate safeguards, which may include encryption or pseudonymisation

If the controller concludes that the new purpose is incompatible with the original purpose, then the only bases to justify the new purpose are consent or a legal obligation (more specifically an EU or Member State law which constitutes a necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic society).
Transparency (Privacy Notices)
The GDPR places considerable emphasis on transparency, that is, the right for a data subject to understand how and why his or her data are used, and what other rights are available to data subjects to control processing. The presentation of granular, yet easily accessible, privacy notices should, therefore, be seen as a cornerstone of GDPR compliance.
Various information must be provided by controllers to data subjects in a concise, transparent and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language.
The following information must be provided at the time the data are obtained:&nbsp;

The identity and contact details of the controller
The data protection officer's contact details (if there is one)
Both the purpose for which data will be processed and the legal basis for processing, including, if relevant, the legitimate interests for processing
The recipients or categories of recipients of the personal data
Details of international transfers
The period for which personal data will be stored or, if that is not possible, the criteria used to determine this
The existence of rights of the data subject including the right to access, rectify, require erasure, restrict processing, object to processing and data portability
Where applicable, the right to withdraw consent, and the right to complain to supervisory authorities
The consequences of failing to provide data necessary to enter into a contract
The existence of any automated decision making and profiling and the consequences for the data subject
In addition, where a controller wishes to process existing data for a new purpose, they must inform data subjects of that further processing, providing the above information

Somewhat different requirements apply where information has not been obtained from the data subject.
Rights of the Data Subject
Data subjects enjoy a range of rights to control the processing of their personal data, some of which are very broadly applicable, whilst others only apply in quite limited circumstances. Controllers must provide information on action taken in response to requests within one calendar month as a default, with a limited right for the controller to extend this period thereby a further two months where the request is onerous.
Right of access&nbsp;
A data subject is entitled to request access to and obtain a copy of his or her personal data, together with prescribed information about the how the data have been used by the controller.
Right to rectify&nbsp;
Data subjects may require inaccurate or incomplete personal data to be corrected or completed without undue delay.
Right to erasure ('right to be forgotten')&nbsp;
Data subjects may request erasure of their personal data. The forerunner of this right made headlines in 2014 when Europe’s highest court ruled against Google (Judgment of the CJEU in Case C-131/12), in effect requiring Google to remove search results relating to historic proceedings against a Spanish national for an unpaid debt on the basis that Google as a data controller of the search results had no legal basis to process that information.
The right is not absolute; it only arises in quite a narrow set of circumstances, notably where the controller no longer needs the data for the purposes for which they were collected or otherwise lawfully processed, or as a corollary of the successful exercise of the objection right, or of the withdrawal of consent.
Right to restriction of processing
Data subjects enjoy a right to restrict processing of their personal data in defined circumstances. These include where the accuracy of the data is contested; where the processing is unlawful; where the data are no longer needed save for legal claims of the data subject, or where the legitimate grounds for processing by the controller are contested.
Right to data portability
Where the processing of personal data is justified either on the basis that the data subject has given his or her consent to processing or where processing is necessary for the performance of a contract, then the data subject has the right to receive or have transmitted to another controller all personal data concerning him or her in a structured, commonly used and machine-readable format (eg,&nbsp;commonly used file formats recognised by mainstream software applications, such as .xsl).
Right to object&nbsp;
Data subjects have the right to object to processing on the legal basis of the legitimate interests of the data controller or where processing is in the public interest. Controllers will then have to suspend processing of the data until such time as they demonstrate “compelling legitimate grounds” for processing which override the rights of the data subject.
In addition, data subjects enjoy an unconditional right to object to the processing of personal data for direct marketing purposes at any time.&nbsp;
The right not to be subject to automated decision making, including profiling
Automated decision making (including profiling) "which produces legal effects concerning [the data subject] … or similarly significantly affects him or her" is only permitted where:&nbsp;

Necessary for entering into or performing a contract
Authorized by EU or Member State law
The data subject has given their explicit (ie, opt-in) consent

Further, where significant automated decisions are taken on the basis of first or third grounds above, the data subject has the right to obtain human intervention, to contest the decision, and to express his or her point of view.1. Processing &nbsp;genetic data, biometric data or health data
The processing of genetic, biometric or health data for the purpose of achieving an automated decision-making process or for profiling purposes is permitted only with the explicit consent of the data subject or if the processing is performed based on express legal requirements, with the obligation to implement adequate measures for the protection of the rights, freedoms and legitimate interests of the data subject. Law no. 190/2018 does not specify or provide any examples with respect to what type of measures should be implemented in view of the processing.
Law no. 190/2018 expressly allows the processing of health data for the purpose of public health, as defined under Regulation (EC) No 1338/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2008 on Community statistics on public health and health and safety at work. However, subsequent processing of such data may not be performed for other purposes &nbsp;by third parties.
2. Processing a national identification number&nbsp;
Law no. 190/2018 provides that processing &nbsp;a national identification number, including by collecting or disclosing any documents enclosing such national identification number, may be carried out in the situations provided for in Article 6 (1) of the GDPR. However, where processing is based on the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party (i.e. Article 6 (1) (f) of the GDPR), the processing activities may be carried out only if the following guarantees have been implemented by the controller:


Adequate technical and organizational measures to observe, in particular, the principle of data minimization and to ensure the security and confidentiality of personal data processing, according to the provisions of art. 32 of the GDPR;


The appointment of a DPO;


Establishment of &nbsp;retention terms in accordance with the nature of the personal data and the purpose of the processing, as well as specific deadlines in which personal data must be deleted or revised in order to be deleted;

Regular training of the personnel processing personal data under the direct authority of the controller or processor.

3. Processing &nbsp;personal data in the context of employment relationships
The electronic monitoring and / or video surveillance systems of employees at the workplace based on the legitimate interests of the employer is / are permitted only if the following apply:

The legitimate interests pursued by the employer are thoroughly justified and prevail over the interests or rights and freedoms of the data subjects;
The employer has made the compulsory, complete and explicit prior information to the employees;
The employer consulted the relevant trade union or, where applicable, the employees' representatives prior to the introduction of the monitoring systems;
Other less intrusive forms and ways to achieve the goal pursued by the employer have not previously proved their effectiveness;
The retention duration of personal data is proportional to the purpose of processing, but not more than 30 days, except for situations expressly governed by law or in duly justified cases.

4. Processing of personal data for journalistic purposes or for the purpose of academic, artistic or literary expression
According to Law no. 190/2018, in view of ensuring a balance between the right&nbsp;to personal data protection, freedom of expression and the right to information, processing of personal data for journalistic purposes, or for the purposes of academic, artistic or literary expression may be performed if such processing refers to personal data which were manifestly made public by the data subject or which are strongly connected to the quality of public person of the data subject or to the public nature of the facts in which the data subject is involved, by derogation from the following chapters of the GDPR:

Chapter II&nbsp;– Principles
Chapter III&nbsp;– Rights of the data subject
Chapter IV&nbsp;– Controller and processor
Chapter V&nbsp;– Transfers of personal data to third countries or international organizations
Chapter VI&nbsp;– Independent supervisory authorities
Chapter VII&nbsp;– Cooperation and consistency
Chapter IX&nbsp;– Provisions relating to specific processing situations

5. Processing of personal data for scientific or historical research purposes, statistical purposes or archiving in the public interest purposes
According to Law no. 190/2018 Articles 15, 16, 18 and 21 of the GDPR do not apply in case personal data are processed for scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes, to the extent the rights mentioned in these Articles are likely to render impossible or seriously impair the achievement of the objectives of the processing, and such derogations are necessary for achieving such objectives. These derogations are applied only with respect to archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes and not with respect to other purposes for which the personal data may be used. Articles 15, 16, 18, 19, 20 and 21 GDPR do not apply in cases where personal data is processed for archiving purposes in the public interest to the extent that the rights mentioned in those Articles are likely to render impossible or seriously impair the achievement of the objectives of the processing, and such derogations are necessary for achieving such objectives. These derogations are applicable only with respect to scientific or historical research purposes and for archiving in the public interest purposes, and not with respect to other purposes for which the personal data may be used. Both these derogations are applicable only if appropriate safeguards for the rights and freedoms of data subjects are implemented, in accordance with Article 89(1) GDPR.&nbsp;
6. Processing of personal data and special categories of personal data by political parties, national minorities organisations and non-governmental organisations for the purpose of fulfilling their objectives
Processing of personal data and special categories of personal data by political parties, national minorities organisations and non-governmental organisations for the purpose of fulfilling their objectives can be done without the explicit consent of the personal data but with the application of the following:

The information of data subjects on the processing of personal data;
Guaranteeing the transparency of the information, of the communications and of the manner in which data subjects can exercise their rights;
Guaranteeing the right to rectification and the right to erasure.&nbsp;&nbsp;
