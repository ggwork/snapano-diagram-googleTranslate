According to Vietnamese laws, the solid legal basis for the processing of personal information (that means the performance of one or some acts of collecting, editing, utilizing, storing, providing, sharing or spreading personal information in cyberspace for commercial purpose) is a prior explicit consent given by the data subject. Specifically, it requires that organizations that process personal information shall collect personal information only after (i) having notified data subjects of the scope, purpose, storage period, form and location of collection, storage, processing, use, disclosure and transfer of such information (the relevant terminologies cover “collect, store, process, use, disclose and transfer” rather than just “collection and processing” of data); and (ii) obtaining their consents before. The traders or organizations collecting and using the consumers’ personal information on E-commerce website must set up the mechanism for the consumers / subjects to clearly express their consent through online functions on the website, e-mail, messages or other methods as agreed by the two parties.
However, based on the specific purpose for processing of personal information, the laws provide an alternative legal basis besides consent. Particularly, organizations may collect, process, use, store, disclose and transfer personal information of other people without the consent when that information is used for the following purposes:

Signing, modifying or performing contracts on the use of information, products or services in the network environment (generally defined as “the environment in which information is provided, transmitted, collected, processed and exchanged via information infrastructure");
Calculating charges for use of information, products or services in the network environment; and
Performing other obligations provided for by law (e.g. at request of competent authority as prescribed in the law of Vietnam).

In addition, the traders and organizations collecting and using consumers’ personal information on E-commerce websites shall not need the consumers / subjects’ prior consent in the following cases:

Collecting personal information that has been publicized on E-commerce websites;
Collecting personal information to sign or perform contract of sale and purchase of goods and services;
Collecting personal information to calculate the price and charge of use of information, products and services on the network environment;
Collection of personal information for performing other obligations in accordance with the law.

Especially, the data controller is required to:


Provide the data subject with their personal information collected and stored by the data controller upon receipt of a request from the data subject;


Immediately comply with the request and notify such data subject or grant him / her the right to access information or to do so upon receipt of a request from the data subject for re-examination, update, correction, modification or cancellation, or for the stoppage of the provision of personal information to a third party, and not supply or use relevant personal information until such information is corrected;


Take necessary measures to protect personal information, and notify the data subject if the data controller fails to comply with its / his / her request for technical or other reasons; and


Delete the stored personal information when they have accomplished their use purposes or the storage time has expired and notify the data subject thereof, unless otherwise prescribed by law.
