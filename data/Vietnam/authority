Vietnam does not have a single national data protection authority. Instead, the authority on State management of certain aspects of information and / or data protection has been given to a number of competent State authorities. To some extent, the key State competent authorities in charge of information and/or data protection would be the Ministry of Information and Communications (“MIC”), the MPS and the Vietnam Cybersecurity Emergency Response Teams / Coordination Center (“VNCERT/CC”) directly managed by the Authority of Information Security (“AIS”) under the MIC. Their key roles are particularly as follows:

MIC, particularly the AIS shall be responsible for management of the provision of cyberspace services (e.g. social network, gaming online, e-commerce, etc.), such as requesting cyberspace service providers to delete illegal data uploaded on their system / network.
MPS, particularly Department for Cybersecurity and High-tech Crime Prevention and Fighting, is responsible for supervision of national cybersecurity, e.g. to request cyberspace service providers to (i) store data in Vietnam and (ii) provide users’ information for serving investigation into cybersecurity crime.
VNCERT/CC acts as the National Coordination Center for response to cybersecurity incidents and information security testing.

In addition to the above, subject to each specific industry (e.g. banking and finance; education; healthcare; natural resources and environment; culture, sports and tourism; etc.), the State management authority in charge of such industry and its IT center shall be involved in relevant information system protection.Last modified 10 Jan 2022
