There is not a single comprehensive data protection law in Vietnam. Instead, regulations on data protection and privacy can be found in various legal instruments. The right of privacy and right of reputation, dignity and honour and fundamental principles of such rights are currently provided for in Constitution 2013 (“Constitution”) and Civil Code 2015 (“Civil Code”) as inviolable and protected by law.
Regarding personal information, the key principles on collection, storage, use, process, disclosure or transfer of personal information are specified in the following main laws and guiding documents, among others:

Criminal Code No. 100/2015/QH13, passed by the National Assembly on 27 November 2015; as amended from time to time (“Criminal Code”);
Law No. 24/2018/QH14 on Cybersecurity, passed by the National Assembly on 12 June 2018 (“Cybersecurity Law”);
Law No. 86/2015/QH13 on Network Information Security, passed by the National Assembly on 19 November 2015; as amended by Law No. 35/2018/QH14 dated 20 November 2018, on amendments to some articles concerning planning of 37 Laws (“Network Information Security Law”);
Law No. 59/2010/QH12 on Protection of Consumers’ Rights, passed by the National Assembly on 17 November 2010; as amended by Law No.35/2018/QH14 dated 20 November 2018, on amendments to some articles concerning planning of 37 Laws (“CRPL”);
Law No. 67/2006/QH11 on Information Technology, passed by the National Assembly on 29 June 2006; as amended by Law No. 21/2017/QH14 dated 14 November 2017 on planning (“IT Law”);
Law No. 51/2005/QH11 on E-transactions, passed by the National Assembly on 29 November 2005 (“E-transactions Law”);
Decree No. 85/2016/ND-CP dated 1 July 2016, on the security of information systems by classification (“Decree 85”);
Decree No. 72/2013/ND-CP dated 15 July 2013 of the Government, on management, provision and use of Internet services and online information; as amended by Decree No. 27/2018/ND-CP dated 1 March 2018 and Decree No.150/2018/ND-CP dated 7 November 2018 (“Decree 72”);
Decree No. 52/2013/ND-CP dated 16 May 2013 of the Government; as amended by Decree No. 08/2018/ND-CP dated 15 January 2018, on amendments to certain Decrees related to business conditions under state management of the Ministry of Industry and Trade and Decree No. 85/2021/ND-CP dated 25 September 2021 (“Decree 52”);
Decree No. 15/2020/ND-CP of the Government dated 3 February 2020 on penalties for administrative violations against regulations on postal services, telecommunications, radio frequencies, information technology and electronic transactions (“Decree 15”);
Circular No. 03/2017/TT-BTTTT of the Ministry of Information and Communications dated 24 April 2017 on guidelines for Decree 85 (“Circular 03”);
Circular No. 20/2017/TT-BTTTT dated 12 September 2017 of the Ministry of Information and Communications, providing for Regulations on coordinating and responding to information security incidents nationwide (“Circular 20”);
Circular No. 38/2016/TT-BTTTT dated 26 December 2016 of the Ministry of Information and Communications, detailing cross-border provision of public information (“Circular 38”);
Circular No. 24/2015/TT-BTTTT dated 18 August 2015 of the Ministry of Information and Communications, providing for the management and use of Internet resources, as amended by Circular No. 06/2019/TT-BTTTT dated 19 July 2019 (“Circular 25”); and
Decision No. 05/2017/QD-TTg of the Prime Minister dated 16 March 2017 on emergency response plans to ensure national cyber-information security (“Decision 05”).

Each aspect and each industry may have their respective regulating documents. In other words, applicability of legal documents will depend on the factual context of each case, e.g businesses in the banking and finance, education, healthcare sectors may be subject to specialized data protection regulations, not to mention to regulations on employees’ personal information as provided in Labour Code 2019 (“Labour Code”).
The most important Vietnamese legal documents regulating data protection are the Cybersecurity Law and Network Information Security Law. However, it is worth noting that, unlike cybersecurity laws in other jurisdictions that were inspired by the GDPR of the EU, the Cybersecurity Law of Vietnam shares similarities with China’s Cybersecurity Law enacted in 2017. Such law focuses on providing the government with the ability to control the flow of information; meanwhile, the Network Information Security Law enforces data privacy rights for individual data subjects.
A draft Decree detailing a number of articles of the Cybersecurity Law (“Draft Cybersecurity Decree”), notably including implementation guidelines for data localization requirements, together with a draft Decree detailing the order of and procedures for application of a number of cybersecurity assurance measures and a draft Decision of the Prime Minister promulgating a List of information systems important for national security, are being prepared by the Ministry of Public Security (“MPS”) in coordination with other relevant ministries, ministerial-level agencies and bodies.
MPS has drafted a Decree on personal data protection (“Draft PDPD”), which is contemplated to consolidate all data protection laws and regulations into one comprehensive data protection law as well as make significant additions and improvements to the existing regulations. The Draft PDPD was released for public comments in February 2021 and was originally scheduled to take effect by December 2021. However, due to the extreme sensitivity of the issues intended to be regulated by the Draft PDPD (including the data localization requirement and regulatory approval for sensitive data processing), the Draft PDPD received immense negative comments from the public and foreign governments. Thus, its finalization process has taken much longer than the MPS first anticipated. As of January 2022, the Draft PDPD still has not been finalized or submitted to the government and National Assembly for final approval. It is anticipated that the Draft PDPD might be finalized and take effect within 2022.Last modified 10 Jan 2022
