Under the laws of Vietnam there is no regulation mandating a typical company to appoint a “DPO”. However, certain types of organizations (e.g. big information system owners and others such as telecoms enterprises, banks, State bodies, information system owners using State budgets, etc.) are required to appoint specialized information security focal points and contact persons to supervise and warn on cyber-information security, etc. These officers are expected to be in charge of incidents rather than data protection issues. Other strict requirements (under various legal documents) are also applicable to such kinds of organizations which do not cover “companies of the private sector”.Last modified 10 Jan 2022
