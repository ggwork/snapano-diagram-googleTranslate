Certificates of registration are valid for at least one year, after which data users must renew registrations and may not continue to process personal data.
Data users are also required to display their certificate of registration at a conspicuous place at their principal place of business, and a copy of the certificate at each branch, where applicable.
The Commissioner may designate a body as a data user forum for a class of data users. Data user forums can prepare codes of practice to govern compliance with the PDPA, which can be registered with the Commissioner. Once registered, all data users must comply with the provisions of the code, and non-compliance violates the PDPA. As of December 15, 2020, the Commissioner has published several codes of practice, including for the banking and financial sector, the aviation sector, the utilities sector, communications sector and the insurance and takaful industry in Malaysia.Last modified 17 Nov 2021
