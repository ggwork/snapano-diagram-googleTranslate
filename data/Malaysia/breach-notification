There is no requirement under the PDPA for data users to notify authorities regarding data breaches in Malaysia though there appears to be a voluntary data breach notification option available on the Personal Data Protection Department's website. News reports dated October 5, 2018 suggest that Malaysia's laws could be updated, to include data breach notification requirements modeled after those under the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), including requiring providing notice to government authorities.
In addition, a news report dated March 20, 2019 reported that the Office of Personal Data Protection Malaysia's deputy commissioner, Rosmahyuddin Baharuddin, has also indicated that data breach notification is something that Malaysia is "seriously considering".
Notably, one of the issues for which feedback is sought in P01/2020 include reporting of data breaches. The points to be considered include, the proposed mandatory data breach notification, the impact of having all data users report about the data, and the elements to be considered in the guideline on data breach incident reporting.Last modified 17 Nov 2021
