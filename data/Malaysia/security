Under the PDPA, data users have an obligation to take ‘practical’ steps to protect personal data, and in doing so, must develop and implement a security policy. The Commissioner may also, from time to time, set out security standards with which the data user must comply, and the data user is required to ensure that its data processors comply with these security standards.
In addition, the Standards provide separate security standards for personal data processed electronically and for personal data processed non-electronically (among others) and require data users to have regard to the Standards in taking practical steps to protect the personal data from any loss, misuse, modification, unauthorized or accidental access or disclosure, alteration or destruction.
Pursuant to PC01/2020, the Commissioner observed that there are many new technologies such as facial recognition and smart trackers being used as data collection endpoints, and thus is considering issuing a policy regarding the endpoint security which uses technologies such as encryption.Last modified 17 Nov 2021
