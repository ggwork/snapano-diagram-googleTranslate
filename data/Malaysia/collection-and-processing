Under the PDPA, subject to certain exceptions, data users are generally required to obtain a data subject’s consent for the processing (which includes collection and disclosure) of his or her personal data. Where consent is required from a data subject under the age of eighteen, the data user must obtain consent from the parent, guardian or person who has parental responsibility for the data subject. The consent obtained from a data subject must be in a form that such consent can be recorded and maintained properly by the data user.
Pursuant to PC01/2020, the Commissioner has sought feedback on its proposal to amend the General Principle provision to add clarity to the data subject's consent, whether it should be in a specific provision and the impact of having a default consent.
Malaysian law contains additional data protection obligations, including, for example, a requirement to notify data subjects regarding the purpose for which their personal data are collected and a requirement to maintain a list of any personal data disclosures to third parties.
On December 23, 2015, the Commissioner published the Personal Data Protection Standard 2015 ("Standards"), which set out the Commission’s minimum requirements for processing personal data. The Standards include the following:

Security Standard For Personal Data Processed Electronically
Security Standard For Personal Data Processed Non-Electronically
Retention Standard For Personal Data Processed Electronically And Non-Electronically
Data Integrity Standard For Personal Data Processed Electronically And Non-Electronically
