There are no statutes that expressly allow the collection and processing of identification information.
The DSA 2018 came into force in full on 8 October 2018. Section 26 of the DSA 2018 has been drafted in very wide terms. The contents of this provision would appear to provide, inter alia, that if anyone without lawful authority collects, sells, keeps possession of, supplies or uses identification information of another person, it would constitute an offence1. The punishment for a&nbsp;first-time offender would be imprisonment of a term not exceeding five years or a fine not exceeding Taka 5,00,000 (approx. US$ 5,950 as at 19 January 2021) or both. The punishment for second-time offenders or repeat offenders would be imprisonment of a term not exceeding 10 years or a fine not exceeding Taka 10,00,000 (approx. US$ 11,900 as at 19 January 2021), or both.
Please note that the DSA 2018 does not contain any exceptions to the Section 26 requirement. However, identification information may be, among other things, collected and stored by a person if he has lawful authority. The term "lawful authority" has not been defined in the DSA 2018. Due to the very recent enactment of this legislation, the Government of Bangladesh has not yet issued any clarification as to what would constitute 'lawful use' and has provided no guidance on what would satisfy the 'lawful authority' requirement. It is for these reasons (among others) that the legislation has been widely criticised.
In our opinion, a person will be deemed to have lawful authority if they are authorized by statute or contract to collect and store such identification information.FootnotesNote 1. Please note that this is an unofficial English translation of the wording of the provision in question.
