National ordinance personal data protection (Landsverordening bescherming persoonsgegevens, National Gazette 2010, Consolidated text no. 84) “(National Ordinance Personal Data Protection”);
General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”) – a regulation of the European Union which became effective on May 25, 2018 – may have implications for a data controller / data processor as the extra-territorial reach of the GDPR is not only relevant to businesses established in the European Union but also to international businesses established in Curaçao which offer goods or services to individuals in the European Union or monitor their behaviour in the European Union.
