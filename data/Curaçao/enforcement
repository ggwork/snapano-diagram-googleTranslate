National Ordinance Personal Data Protection&nbsp;
Pursuant to article 54 the responsible party who acts in contravention of the provisions of or pursuant to Article 4(3) may be penalized by the Curaçao committee of data protection with a financial penalty in the maximum amount of Naf. 10,000.00 (USD. 5,714.29. 2).&nbsp;
GDPR&nbsp;
The GDPR holds a variety of potential penalties for businesses.&nbsp;
For example, article 77 of GDPR states that:&nbsp;
“Every data subject shall have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the Member State of his or her habitual residence, place of work or place of the alleged infringement if the data subject considers that the processing of personal data relating him or her infringes this Regulation.”&nbsp;
Additionally, article 79 of the Regulation states that “such proceedings may be brought before the courts of the Member State where the data subject has his or her habitual residence.”&nbsp;
Penalties&nbsp;
Compensation to Data Subjects. One penalty that may be imposed is compensation to, as stated in article 82 of the Regulation, “Any person who has suffered material or non-material damage as a result of an infringement of this Regulation” for the damage they’ve suffered.&nbsp;
Fines&nbsp;
Article 83 of GDPR specifies a number of different fines that may vary based on the nature of the infraction, its severity, and the level of cooperation that “data processors” (i.e. you) provide to the “supervisory authority.” Less severe infringements may incur administrative fines of up to 10,000,000 Euros or 2% of your total worldwide annual turnover for the preceding year (whichever is greater), while more severe infractions may double these fines (20,000,000 or 4% annual turnover).&nbsp;
Individual Member States of the EU may have additional fines and penalties that may be applied as well. However, these additional penalties are not specifically listed in the text of the Regulation since they’re up to the individual EU nations to set—the only guidelines in article 84 of GDPR are that “Such penalties shall be effective, proportionate and dissuasive” and that “Each Member State shall notify to the Commission the provisions of its law which it adopts pursuant to paragraph 1, by 25 May 2018.”Last modified 21 Dec 2021
