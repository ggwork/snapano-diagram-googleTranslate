Under the Electronic Transactions Act, a violation of the data protection duty or the duties of a data processor is subject to a fine of between 30 to 90 minimum wage salaries of the public administration sector, in the absence of a more serious punishment.
The Penal Code (Law n.Â° 24/2019 of December 24) provides for certain cybercrimes, such as intrusion of automated database, which is subject to imprisonment of up to two years and a corresponding fine. There are also other cybercrimes such as &nbsp;fraud through electronic means and unauthorized use of data resulting in unjust enrichment, which are subject to imprisonment generally from a year up to five years and a corresponding fine. The new Penal Code attempts to bridge the gap by identifying cybercrimes related to data protection which are punishable.
However, given that Mozambique does not have specific data protection laws nor a specific authority responsible for overseeing data protection matters, enforcement of data protection-related matters is minimal.Last modified 10 Dec 2021
