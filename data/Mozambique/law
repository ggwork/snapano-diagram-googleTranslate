In Mozambique there is no specific legislation on data protection or privacy. However, there are other sources of law that impose some privacy obligations, including:

The Civil Code (Decree-Law no. 47344, of November 25, 1966, in force in Mozambique through Edict no. 22869, dated September 4, 1967)
The Penal Code (Law n.° 24/2019, of December 24)
The Labour Law (Law n.º 23/2007, of August 1)
The Electronic Transactions Law (Law n.º 3/2017, of January 9)&nbsp;

In addition, the Constitution of the Republic of Mozambique provides that all citizens are entitled to the protection of their private life and have the right to honor, good name, reputation, protection of their public image and privacy. Further, Article 71 of the Constitution identifies the need to legislate on access, generation, protection and use of computerized personal data (either by public or private entities); however, implementing legislation has not yet been approved.Last modified 10 Dec 2021
