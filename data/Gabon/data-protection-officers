No, the appointment of a DPO is left at the exclusive discretion of the data controller. In any event, we call attention to the concept of DPO in the context of the Gabon law. Indeed, the position of DPO in the Data Protection Law is not entirely aligned with the terms in which this position is defined and approached in the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) ('GDPR'). Please note that the Data Protection Law precedes the GDPR and has not since been amended. Rather, the concept is interpreted, in practice, as a position whereby a person assumes responsibilities on data protection within the company, and as a potential point of contact with the CNPDCP.&nbsp;
Notwithstanding the above, this position must be a person with the required qualifications to carry out its role, namely professional qualities, in particular relating to knowledge of law and data protection related matters. If this position exists within the data controller's organisation, this must be made known to the CNPDCP.Last modified 10 Jan 2022
