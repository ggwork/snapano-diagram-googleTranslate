If the Data Protection Commissioner is satisfied that a registered person has contravened or is contravening any of the data protection principles, the Data Protection Commissioner may serve that person with an enforcement notice requiring him to take such steps for complying with the principle or principles in question. In deciding whether to serve an enforcement notice the Data Protection Commissioner shall consider whether the contravention has caused or is likely to cause any person damage or distress.
An enforcement notice in respect of a contravention of the data protection principle concerning data accuracy may require the user to rectify or erase the data and any other data held by him containing an expression of opinion which appears to the Data Protection Commissioner to be based on the inaccurate data.
If by reason of special circumstances the Data Protection Commissioner considers that the steps required by an enforcement notice should be taken as a matter of urgency, he may include a statement to that effect in the notice.
The Data Protection Commissioner may cancel an enforcement notice by written notification to the person on whom it was served.
Any person who fails to comply with an enforcement notice shall be guilty of an offences; but it shall be a defence for the person charged with an offence under this subsection to prove that he exercised all due diligence to comply with the notice in question.
If the Data Protection Commissioner is satisfied that a registered person has contravened or is contravening any of the data protection principles, the Commissioner may serve the person with a de-registration notice stating that the Data Protection Commissioner proposes to remove from the register all or any of the particulars constituting the entry or any of the entries contained in the register in respect of that person. In deciding whether to serve a de-registration notice, the Data Protection Commissioner shall consider whether the contravention has caused or is likely to cause any person damage or distress, and the Data Protection Commissioner shall not serve such a notice unless he is satisfied that compliance with the principle or principles in question cannot be adequately secured by the service of an enforcement notice.Last modified 14 Jan 2020
