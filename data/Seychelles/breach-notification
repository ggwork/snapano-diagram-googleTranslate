Breach notification
There is no mandatory requirement in the Act to report data security breaches or losses to the Data Protection Commissioner. However, the Act provides that the Data Protection Commissioner may consider any complaint that any of the data protection principles or any provision of this Act has been or is being contravened and shall do so if the complaint appears to him to raise a matter of substance and to have been made without undue delay by a person directly affected.
Where the Data Protection Commissioner investigates any such complaint he shall notify the complainant of the result of his investigation and of any action which he proposes to take.
