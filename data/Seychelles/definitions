Definition of personal data
Personal data is defined under the Act as data consisting of information which relates to a living individual who can be identified from that information (or from that and other information in the possession of the data user), including any expression of opinion about the individual but not any indication of the intentions of the data user in respect of that individual.
Definition of sensitive personal data
The Act does not define sensitive personal data. However the Act makes provision for the Minister to modify or supplement the Data Protection Principles set out in the Act for the purpose of providing additional safeguards in relation to personal data consisting of information as to:

the racial origin of the data subject
his political opinions or religious or other beliefs
his physical or mental health or his sexual life, or
his criminal convictions.
