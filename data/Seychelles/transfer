If it appears to the Data Protection Commissioner that a person registered as a data user (or as a data user who also carries on a computer bureau) intends to transfer personal data held by him to a place outside the Seychelles, the Data Protection Commissioner may, if satisfied that the transfer is likely to contravene or lead to a contravention of any data protection principle, serve that person with a transfer prohibition notice prohibiting him from transferring the data either absolutely or until he has taken such steps as are specified in the notice for protecting the interests of the data subjects in question.
In deciding whether to serve a transfer prohibition notice, the Data Protection Commissioner shall consider whether the notice is required for preventing damage or distress to any person and shall have regard to the general desirability of facilitating the free transfer of data between the Seychelles and other states.
A transfer prohibition notice shall specify the time when it is to take effect and contain a statement of the principle or principles which the Data Protection Commissioner is satisfied are contravened and his reasons for reaching that conclusion, as well as particulars of the right of appeal conferred by the Act.
The Data Protection Commissioner may cancel a transfer prohibition notice by written notification to the person on whom it was served.
No transfer prohibition notice shall prohibit the transfer of any data where the transfer of the information constituting the data is required or authorised by or under any enactment or is required by any convention or other instrument imposing an international obligation on the Seychelles.
Any person who contravenes a transfer prohibition notice shall be guilty of an offence but it shall be a defence for a person charged with an offence under this subsection to prove that he exercised all due diligence to avoid a contravention of the notice in question.Last modified 14 Jan 2020
