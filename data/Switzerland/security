The data controller and any processor must take adequate technical and organizational measures to protect personal data against unauthorized processing and ensure its confidentiality, availability and integrity. In particular, personal data must be protected against the following risks:

Unauthorized or accidental destruction
Accidental loss
Technical errors
Forgery, theft or unlawful use
Unauthorized altering, copying, accessing or other unauthorized processing

The technical and organizational measures must be appropriate, in particular with regard to the purposes of the data processing, the scope and manner of the data processing, the risks for the data subjects and the current technological standards. The DPO sets out these requirements in more detail.
The revised DPO may impose additional or other minimum requirements. A draft version of the DPO has been published, but met harsh criticism in the consultation process, in particular as it contained further obligations without legal basis in the underlying DPA. It is expected that the DPO will be redrafted substantially before being enacted.
Under the revised DPA, violations of the minimum data security requirements (which yet remain to be defined in detail by the Federal Council) will be subject to sanctions.Last modified 31 Dec 2021
