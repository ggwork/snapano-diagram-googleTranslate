There is no requirement under the current and the revised Swiss data protection law to appoint a data protection officer.
However, under the current law a data controller can be dispensed from registering its data files if it has designated a data protection officer who:

Carries out his / her duties autonomously and independently
Has a certain level of expertise that is appropriate for the relevant data processing at the company (whereas it is not relevant whether or not the respective expertise was acquired in Switzerland)
Must check and audit the processing of personal data within the company
Must be in a position to recommend corrective measures when detecting any breaches of applicable data protection rules
Must have access to all data files and all data processing within the company as well as to all other information that he/she requires to fulfill his/her duties
Must maintain records of all data files controlled by the company and provide this list to the FDPIC or affected data subjects upon request, and
May not carry out any other activities that are incompatible with his/her duties as data protection officer

The data controller must notify the FDPIC of the appointment of a data protection officer and thereupon such data controller will be listed on the public list of companies exempt from the requirement to register their data files.
The revised DPA also provides that controllers have the option to appoint a data protection officer whose contact data may be published and notified to the FDPIC. In such case, the controller has no obligation to consult with the FDPIC in the event that a data protection impact assessment indicates a significant risk to the personality or the fundamental rights of the data subject.Last modified 31 Dec 2021
