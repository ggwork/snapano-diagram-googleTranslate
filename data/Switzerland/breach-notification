The current DPA does not impose an explicit statutory requirement to notify the FDPIC or the affected data subjects of data security breaches. However, depending on the scale and severity of a breach, a notification of the data subjects may be necessary based on the data controller's and processor's obligation to ensure data security (to avoid further damage), the principle of good faith or pursuant to contractual obligations.
The revised DPA introduces the obligation to notify the FDPIC of any data breach, however only if the breach is probable to result in a high risk to the personality rights or the fundamental rights of the data subject. The notification has to occur as soon as possible. In addition, a formal obligation to notify the data subject exists under the revised DPA in case that such notification is necessary to protect the data subject's interests or if the FDPIC so requests.Last modified 31 Dec 2021
