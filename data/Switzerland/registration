Under the current DPA the processing of personal data by private persons does not usually have to be notified or registered, respectively. However, private persons must register their data files before the data files are opened, if:

They regularly process sensitive personal data or personality profiles, or
They regularly disclose personal data to third parties;

...and if none of the following exemptions applies:

The data is processed pursuant to a statutory obligation.
The Swiss Federal Council has exempted the particular processing from the registration requirement because it does not prejudice the rights of the data subjects (which the Swiss Federal Council has done in the DPO, inter alia, regarding data files from suppliers or customers, provided they do not contain any sensitive personal data or personality profiles).
The data controller uses the data exclusively for publication in the edited section of a periodically published medium and does not pass on any data to third parties without informing the data subjects.
The data is processed by journalists who use the data file exclusively as a personal work aid.
The data controller has designated a data protection officer who independently monitors internal compliance with data protection regulations and maintains a list of the data files.
The data controller has acquired a data protection quality mark under a certification procedure and has notified the FDPIC of the result of the evaluation.

The revised DPA provides for a general duty for controllers and processors to maintain a list of processing activities with certain minimal information, whereby the Federal Council may provide for exceptions for companies with less than 250 employees and whose processing entails only a low risk of infringing the personality of the data subjects.Last modified 31 Dec 2021
