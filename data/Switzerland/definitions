Definition of personal data
Personal data means all information relating to an identified or identifiable natural or legal person. It should be noted that data relating to legal entities falls within the scope of current Swiss data protection law, as opposed to the GDPR. However, the revised DPA will, like the GDPR, apply only to personal data pertaining to individuals.
Definition of sensitive personal data
Sensitive personal data is defined as data on:

Religious, ideological, political or trade union related views or activities
Health, the intimate sphere or racial or ethnic origin
Social security measures
Administrative or criminal proceedings and sanctions

The revised DPA provides that in addition genetic data and biometric data which unequivocally identifies a natural person be considered "sensitive personal data".
The current DPA defines "personality profiles" as collections of data that permit an assessment of essential characteristics of the personality of a natural person and assigns them the same level of protection as "sensitive personal data".
The revised DPA will replace the concept of "personality profiles" with the concept of "profiling", similar to that notion under the GDPR, with "high-risk profiling" (entailing a high risk to the personality or fundamental rights of the data subject) being subject to more stringent requirements similar to "sensitive personal data".Last modified 31 Dec 2021
