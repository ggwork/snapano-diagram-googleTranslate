Data Processing Principles
The following principles apply to the collection and processing of personal data (while under current law personal data of legal entities is included, the revised DPA will apply only to personal data pertaining to individuals):

Personal data may only be processed lawfully, in good faith and according to the principle of proportionality. In addition, the revised DPA introduces the concepts of privacy by design and default.&nbsp;
The collection of personal data and, in particular, the purpose of its processing must be evident to the data subject. In addition, the revised DPA explicitly introduces the following duties on data controllers:

Duty to inform the data subject on the collection of personal data similar as under the GDPR, with the list of minimum information being shorter (however providing for information on the countries of processing), but drafted more openly with a non-exhaustive list of minimum information;
Under certain circumstances the duty to inform the data subject on decisions based solely on automated processing that have legal consequences or significant impact on the data subject (automated individual decision).

Personal data should only be processed for a purpose that is indicated or agreed at the time of collection, evident from the circumstances at the time of collection, or provided for by law.
The data controller and any processor must ensure that the data processed is accurate. Personal data must not be transferred abroad if the privacy of the data subject may be seriously endangered (see below).
Personal data must be protected from unauthorized processing by appropriate technical and organizational measures.
Personal data must not be processed against the explicit will of the data subject, unless this is justified by:

An overriding private or public interest, or
law, and

Sensitive personal data or personality files must not be disclosed to a third party, unless this is justified by:

the consent of the data subject (which must be given expressly in addition to being voluntary and based on adequate information)
an overriding private or public interest


Whilst the current DPA does not provide for a formal duty to conduct a data protection impact assessment, the revised DPA introduces such formal obligation if the processing may constitute a high risk for the personality or the fundamental rights of the data subject (particularly when new technologies are used) and also defines specific cases where a data protection impact assessment is necessary, including in the event of processing sensitive personal data on a broad scale and systematic surveillance of extensive public areas. The FDPIC generally needs to be notified if the data protection impact assessment shows that the processing presents a high risk for the personality or fundamental rights of the data subject despite the measures envisaged by the controller.
Rights of the Data Subject
Data subjects enjoy certain rights to control the processing of their personal data:
Right of access
A data subject is generally entitled to request access to, and obtain a copy of, his or her personal data that is contained in a "data file" (or, under the revised DPA, that is being processed), together with prescribed information on the identity and contact details of the controller, the source of the data, the purpose of, and if applicable the legal basis for, the processing as well as the categories of personal data processed, the other parties involved with the file and the data recipients. The revised DPA requires additionally that the period of storage of personal data (or the criteria used to determine such period) and, if applicable, the existence of an automated individual decision as well as the logic on which the decision is based is provided to the data subject. There are certain exceptions, eg a data controller may invoke its own overriding interests, however only if it does not disclose the personal data to third parties (whereby companies controlled by the same legal entity are not considered third parties under the revised DPA).
Right to rectify / Right to erasure / Right to restriction of processing / Right to object
Data subjects may generally require inaccurate or incomplete personal data to be corrected or complemented. In addition, the above-mentioned rights may arise from the general data protection principles, in particular the principle of proportionality (i.e. the data must only be processed to the extent and as long it is required to achieve the legitimate processing purpose). The revised DPA explicitly states that data must be erased or anonymized once it is no longer required to achieve the processing purpose.
Right to data portability
Whilst current data protection law does not explicitly provide for any right to data portability, the revised DPA introduces such a right similar as in the GDPR.Last modified 31 Dec 2021
