Transfer is considered a form of 'treatment' of personal data under the DPL; hence, the rules apply, including consent requirements. Additional restrictions are provided under the DPL for international data transfers.
Personal data may only be transferred internationally if the owner of the data expressly authorizes such transfer, or if such transfer is necessary for the performance of a contract between the owner of the data and the person or entity responsible for the treatment of the personal data.Last modified 24 Jan 2022
