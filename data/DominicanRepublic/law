Section 44 of the Dominican Constitution recognizes citizensâ€™ right to access their personal data stored in public or private databases, as well as their right to information concerning the purpose and use of the same.
The Constitution also establishes that the processing of personal data must be carried out in accordance to the principles of:

Reliability
Legality
Integrity
Security, and
Purpose of the information

&nbsp;The collection, storage and safekeeping of personal data, as well as usage and access rights concerning such personal data, are governed by the provisions of Law No. 172-13 on the Protection of Personal Data enacted December 13, 2013 (DPL).
In addition to setting forth the legal regime for the protection of personal data, the DPL establishes regulations governing the constitution and operation of credit bureaus.
For the purposes of the DPL, the term 'credit bureau' refers to companies dedicated to collecting, organizing, storing, conserving, providing, transferring or transmitting data regarding consumers (including goods and services related to the same), as well as any other information provided by the Superintendent of Banks.Last modified 24 Jan 2022
