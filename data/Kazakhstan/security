Protection of personal data is guaranteed by the state and is carried out in a manner determined by the Kazakhstan Government.
Collection and processing of personal data is carried out only if its protection is ensured. Kazakh law defines protection of personal data as a set of legal, organization and technical measures.
The owner and / or operator of a personal data database and a third party having access to such database are required to take measures for protecting personal data in a manner determined by the Kazakhstan Government, which ensure:

prevention of unauthorized access to personal data
timely detection of the facts relating to an incident of unauthorized access to personal data, if such unauthorized access could not be prevented
minimizing adverse effects of unauthorized access to personal data
the state technical serviceâ€™s access to objects of informatisation that use, store, process and distribute limited access personal data contained in electronic information resources, so that the state technical service could carry out a survey to asses the security level of the processes of storage, processing and distribution of limited access personal data contained in electronic information resources in the manner determined by the authorized body.

The obligations of an owner and / or operator of a database containing personal data and a third party having access to such database to protect personal data arise from the moment of collecting the personal data and remain in force until such personal data is destroyed or depersonalized.&nbsp;Kazakh law provides for additional requirements with regard to protection of electronic resources containing personal data.Last modified 21 Feb 2022
