Definition of personal data
'Personal data' is any information relating to a specific individual (personal data subject) or a&nbsp;personal data subject who can be identified on the basis of such information which is recorded on electronic, paper and / or another tangible medium.
The law divides personal data into:

'Generally accessible personal data', which is personal data that can be accessed freely with the consent of the personal data subject or to which confidentiality requirements do not apply in accordance with Kazakh law, and
'Limited access personal data', which is personal data, access to which is limited by Kazakh law

Definition of sensitive personal data
Kazakh law does not provide for express definition of sensitive personal data.&nbsp;
In certain cases, sensitive personal data may qualify as limited access personal data and, as such, it is additionally regulated by sector-specific laws of Kazakhstan (e.g. medical secrecy, subscriber data). In our replies, we do not consider sector-specific restrictions which may affect personal data regulation (e.g. Kazakh law prohibits transfer of subscriber data, which includes, inter alia, personal data of subscribers).Last modified 21 Feb 2022
