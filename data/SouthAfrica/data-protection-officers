Data protection officers (referred to in POPIA as "information officers") must be registered with the Information Regulator. The duties and responsibilities of a responsible party's information officer are set forth in POPIA and include encouraging and ensuring compliance with POPIA; dealing with any requests made to that responsible party in terms of POPIA; and working with the Information Regulator in respect of investigations by the Information Regulator in relation to that responsible party. The Regulations to POPIA, among other things, further provide that the information officer must ensure that a compliance framework is developed, implemented, monitored and maintained, and that a personal information impact assessment is conducted to ensure that adequate measures and standards exist.Last modified 20 Dec 2021
