The right to privacy is recognized as a fundamental human right in the Bill of Rights of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa and is protected in terms of the Constitution and the common law. This right to privacy is not absolute and may be limited where it is reasonable and justifiable to do so.
The Protection of Personal Information Act 4 of 2013 (POPIA) came into effect on 1 July 2020, but there was a one year grace period within which to comply with POPIA. It is now almost fully in force (see below). &nbsp;POPIA specifically regulates the processing of personal information that is entered into a record pertaining to natural living persons as well as existing legal persons.
Recent developments
POPIA came into force on 1 July 2020 but was subject to a 12 month grace period, which ended on 30 June 2021. POPIA is now accordingly in force in its entirety save for the provisions regarding prior authorization, which will only come into effect on 1 February 2022. This means that all responsible parties (i.e. data controllers) that conduct processing activities that are subject to prior authorization will need to submit an application for prior authorization by 1 February 2022 and will need to cease such processing activities until such time as prior authorization is obtained. A number of guidance notes were issued by the Information Regulator during 2021, as follows:

Guidance Note on Applications for Prior Authorisation;
Guidance Note on Information Officers and Deputy Information Officers;
Guidance Note on Exemptions from the Conditions for Lawful Processing;
Guidance Note on Processing of Special Personal Information; and
Guide on how to use the Promotion of Access to Information Act, 2000 and exemption of certain bodies from having a PAIA Manual.



The President of the Republic of South Africa announced by presidential proclamation on 22 June 2020, that POPIA will finally come into force on 1 July 2020, with the exception of certain provisions coming into force on 30 June 2021. The following sections shall come into force on 1 July 2020:

The purposes and application provisions,
The 8 conditions for lawful processing,
The restrictions on processing of special personal information and personal information relating to children;
The exemption provisions;
The provisions relating to Information Officers;&nbsp;
Prior authorization requirements;

The enforcement, offences and sanctions provisions;
Certain general provisions relating to fees and the transitional arrangements.

(Sections 2 to 38; sections 55 to 109; section 111 and section 114 (1) (2) (3))
To allow for operational readiness of the Information Regulator, the following sections, will only come into force on 30 June 2021:

The amendment of laws; and
The effective date of transfer of functions of the Promotion of Access to Information Act from the South African Human Rights Commission to the Information Regulator. (Sections 110 and 114 (4))

There will be a one-year grace period within which to comply with POPIA and the Regulations enacted thereunder. Private and public bodies should ensure compliance by 1 July 2021.
