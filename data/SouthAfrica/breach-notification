In terms of section 22 of POPIA, where there are reasonable grounds to believe that the personal information of a data subject has been accessed or acquired by any unauthorized person, the responsible party must notify the Information Regulator and the data subject, unless the identity of such data subject cannot be established.
The notification must be made as soon as reasonably possible after the discovery of the compromise, taking into account the legitimate needs of law enforcement or any measures reasonably necessary to determine the scope of the compromise and to restore the integrity of the responsible partyâ€™s information system.
The responsible party may only delay notification of the data subject if a public body responsible for the prevention, detection or investigation of offenses or the Information Regulator determines that notification will impede a criminal investigation by the public body concerned and must be in writing and communicated to the data subject in a prescribed manner.
The notification must provide sufficient information to allow the data subject to take protective measures against the potential consequences of the compromise, including all of the following:

A description of the possible consequences of the security compromise


A description of the measures that the responsible party intends to take or has taken to address the security compromise


A recommendation with regard to the measures to be taken by the data subject to mitigate the possible adverse effects of the security compromise&nbsp;


If known to the responsible party, the identity of the unauthorized person who may have accessed or acquired the personal information

The Information Regulator may direct a responsible party to publicize, in any manner specified, the fact of any compromise to the integrity or confidentiality of personal information, if the Information Regulator has reasonable grounds to believe that such publicity would protect a data subject who may be affected by the compromise.
An operator / data processor is not required to notify the Information Regulator or data subjects where there are reasonable grounds to believe that there has been a data breach. It must, however, notify the responsible party/data controller of the suspected data breach.Last modified 20 Dec 2021
