Data protection officers (referred to in POPIA as "information officers") must be registered with the Information Regulator.&nbsp;
The responsible party is required to obtain prior authorization from the Information Regulator before processing personal information in certain circumstances prescribed in section 57 of POPIA, for example, where special personal information or personal information of children is transferred to a third party in a foreign country that does not provide an adequate level of protection for the processing of personal information and where information on criminal behavior or unlawful or objectionable conduct is processed on behalf of third parties. Prior authorization is also required when processing personal information for the purposes of credit reporting or when processing unique identifiers for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was originally collected and linking it with personal information processed by other third parties. The responsible party is not otherwise required to register its processing of personal information.
The prior authorization requirements in POPIA will only come into effect on 1 February 2022. This means that all responsible parties (i.e. data controllers) that conduct processing activities that are subject to prior authorization will need to submit an application for prior authorization by 1 February 2022 and will need to cease such processing activities until such time as prior authorization is obtained.Last modified 20 Dec 2021
