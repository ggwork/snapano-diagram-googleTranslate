Any person may submit a complaint to the Information Regulator alleging non-compliance with POPIA. The Information Regulator may also initiate an investigation into interference with the protection of personal information.
Upon receipt of a complaint, the Information Regulator may, inter alia, conduct a pre-investigation or full investigation of the complaint, act as conciliator, refer the complaint to another regulatory body if the Information Regulator considers that the complaint falls more properly within the jurisdiction of the other regulatory body, or decide to take no further action.
The Information Regulator's powers, for purposes of investigating a complaint include the power to summons and enforce the appearance of persons before the Information Regulator to give evidence or produce records or things; enter and search the premises occupied by a responsible party; and conduct interviews and inquiries.
If the Information Regulator is satisfied that a responsible party has interfered or is interfering with the protection of the personal information of a data subject it my issue an enforcement notice prescribing action to be taken by the responsible party to remedy the situation.
A responsible party who fails to comply with an enforcement notice is guilty of an offense and is, liable, on conviction, to a fine or imprisonment (or both) for a period of no longer than ten years (in terms of section 107), or alternatively to an administrative fine (in terms of section 109). Currently, the maximum fine under sections 107 and 109 of POPIA is R10 million.
Section 99 also makes provision for a civil action for damages resulting from non-compliance with POPIA. In order to succeed in such a claim the complainant would need to prove all the elements of a delict: wrongful conduct, causation, fault (intent / negligence) and harm. The data subject would need to prove the quantum of the damages that s/he seeks.Last modified 20 Dec 2021
