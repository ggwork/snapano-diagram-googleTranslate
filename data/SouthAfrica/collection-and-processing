"Processing" of information is defined in POPIA as any operation or activity or any set of operations, whether or not by automatic means, concerning personal information, including:

The collection, receipt, recording, organization, collation, storage, updating or modification, retrieval, alteration, consultation or use


Dissemination by means of transmission, distribution or making available in any other form&nbsp;

Purpose specification: Personal information must only be collected for a specific, explicitly defined lawful purpose related to a function or activity of the responsible party.


Processing limitation: Processing must be justified on a ground recognized under POPIA (eg,&nbsp;consent/legitimate interests of the data subject, responsible party or the third party to whom the information is supplied).


Further processing limitation: Processing must be in accordance with or compatible with the purpose for which it was initially collected subject to limited exceptions.


Information quality: Steps must be taken to ensure that the information is complete, accurate, not misleading and updated where necessary.


Openness: Notification requirements must be complied with when collecting personal information.


Security safeguards: Appropriate, reasonable technical and organizational measures must be implemented and maintained to prevent loss of, damage to or unauthorized destruction of or unlawful access to personal information.


Data subject participation: Data subjects have the right to request details of the personal information that a responsible party holds about them and, in certain circumstances, request access to such information.
