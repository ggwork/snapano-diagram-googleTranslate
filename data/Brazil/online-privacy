The Brazilian Internet Act has several provisions concerning the storage, use, disclosure, and other processing of data collected on the Internet. The established rights of privacy, intimacy, and consumer rights apply equally to electronic media, such as mobile devices and the Internet. Violations of these rights may also be subject to civil enforcement.
Furthermore, as explained in prior sections, identifiable data are also encompassed under the scope of protection of the LGPD. Thus, if cookies and location data are associated with a natural person, their collection should also observe the same obligations provided by the Brazilian data protection law. However, the obligation does not apply to anonymized data, which is not considered personal data under the LGPD unless the process of anonymization has been reversed or can be reversed using reasonable efforts.
That said, a proper legal basis is needed when using cookies and similar technologies that involve the processing of a user’s personal data from (e.g., the information is linked or linkable to a particular user, IP address, a device, or other particular identifier). Under this scenario, two available legal bases could be used, depending on the analysis of the concrete case: the data subject’s consent or the controller’s legitimate interest (in the case of essential cookies, for example).Last modified 24 Jan 2022
