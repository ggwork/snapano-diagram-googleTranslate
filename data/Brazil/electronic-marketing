Brazil has no specific law regulating electronic marketing communications. However, it is important to point out that, according to the LGPD, all processing of consumers’ personal data (which includes the collection, storage, and sending of marketing communications) can only occur upon the appropriate legal basis for such purpose. Under this scenario, two available legal bases could be used, depending on the analysis of the concrete case: (1) the data subject’s consent, or (2) the controller’s legitimate interest.
Despite the lack of a specific statute, general provisions on privacy and intimacy rights, as well as consumer protection rights, also apply to electronic marketing. Therefore, the sender should immediately cease sending any electronic marketing if the consumer requests (i.e., offering an opt-out option to electronic marketing).Last modified 24 Jan 2022
