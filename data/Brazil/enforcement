The LGPD provides for penalties in case of violations its provisions. Data processing agents that commit infractions can be subject to administrative sanctions, in a gradual, single or cumulative manner, including a fine, simple or daily, of up to 2% of the revenues of a private legal entity, group or conglomerate in Brazil, up to a total maximum of R$50 million per infraction.
Other sanctions can include:

Warning
Publicizing of the violation
Blocking the personal data to which the infraction refers to until its regularization
Deletion of the personal data to which the infraction refers
Partial suspension of the database operation to which the infringement refers for a maximum period of six (6) months, extendable for the same period, until the processing activity is corrected by the controller;
Suspension of the personal data processing activity to which the infringement refers for a maximum period of six (6) months, extendable for the same period;
Partial or total prohibition of activities related to data processing.

Although the LGPD became effective September 18, 2020, the penalties provided by the law were only enforceable from August 1, 2021. In addition, the ANPD is now in operation and, on October 29, 2021, published the Regulation of the Inspection Process and the Sanctioning Administrative Process, which establishes the procedures applicable to ANPDâ€™s inspection process and the rules to be observed during the administrative sanctioning process. However, so far, the ANPD still has not imposed sanctions regarding violations to the LGPD, so its level of enforcement activity is still uncertain.
Public authorities (such as consumer protection bodies and public prosecutors) are already monitoring data protection matters and applying penalties based on the LGPD obligations and other applicable laws. Additionally, data subjects may file lawsuits if any of the rights provided by the LGPD are violated. Under the law, a controller or processor that causes material, moral, individual, or collective damage to others is liable to individuals for such damages, including through a class action.
Exceptions to the obligation to remedy a violation exist only if:

The agent (ie, controller or the processor) did not carry out the data processing
There was no violation of the data protection legislation in the processing, or
The damage arises due to exclusive fault of the data subject or a third party
