The LGPD established the National Data Protection Authority (ANPD). The ANPD is part of the federal public administration, (pertaining to the Presidency of the Republic), and is given technical and decision-making autonomy with jurisdiction over the Brazilian territory. The ANPD isheadquartered in the Federal District. The legal nature of ANPD is transitory and may be amended by the Public Authority into an entity of the indirect federal public administration, subject to special autarchic regime and linked to the Presidency of the Republic, within two (2) years of its regimental structure coming into force.
&nbsp;The ANPD is now in operation. Its structuring process started on August 27, 2020, with the publication of Decree No. 10,474/2020, which approved and regulated the regulatory structure of the ANPD, and its board of commissioned positions and nominated trust functions. On November 6, 2020, this Decree entered into force with the appointment of the Director-President and the members of the Board of Directors of the ANPD, after having been approved by the plenary of the Federal Senate.&nbsp;On March 9, 2021, the ANPDâ€™s Internal Regulations were published, establishing the competencies and organization of the National Authority.
The ANPD is composed of:

A Board of Directors
A national council for Personal Data and Privacy Protection (Council)
Bodies of direct and immediate assistance to the Board of Directors (General Secretariat, General Coordination of Administration, General Coordination of Institutional and International Relations)
An Internal Affairs Office (inspection body)
An ombudsman
Its own legal advisory body, and
Administrative and specialized units for the enforcement of the LGPD (ie, General Coordination of Standardization; General Coordination of Supervision; and General Coordination of Technology and Research)

The ANPD has the authority to issue sanctions for violations of the LGPD. This sanctions authority came into force on August 1, 2021. In August 2021, the President of the Republic appointed representatives of the National Council for Personal Data and Privacy Protection (Council). The Council contributes to the performance of the ANPD and has the authority to, among other things:

Oversee the protection of personal data
Issue regulations and procedures related to personal data protection
Deliberate, at an administrative level, upon the interpretation of the LGPD and matters omitted in its redaction
Supervise and apply sanctions in the event of data processing performed in violation of the legislation
Implement simplified mechanisms for recording complaints about the processing of personal data in violation of the LGPD

In addition, the ANPD Council is responsible for, among other functions:

Proposing strategic guidelines and allowance for the creation of the National Policy for the Protection of Personal Data and the operation of ANPD
Suggesting actions to be carried out by the ANPD
Preparing studies and conducting public debates and hearings about the protection of personal data

Since the ANPD started its operations, several actions have already been implemented to protect personal data, including:

Publishing guidance on reporting a security incident with personal data and its assessment to the ANPD
Explaining availability of a claim by the data subject against controller
Providing educational materials on data protection, such as (1) guidelines for defining personal data processing agents and the DPO, (2) how consumers should protect their personal data, and (3) information security for small processing agents.

However, there are still several provisions of the LGPD requiring further regulation and interpretation by the ANPD, which stakeholders should monitor for future compliance.Last modified 24 Jan 2022
