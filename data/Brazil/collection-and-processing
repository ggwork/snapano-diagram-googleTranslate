Under the LGPD, collection and processing is referred to as "data treatment", and defined as all operations carried out with personal data, such as:

Collection
Production
Reception
Classification
Utilization
Access
Reproduction
Transmission
Distribution
Processing
Filing
Storage
Elimination
Evaluation
Control
Modification
Communication
Transfer
Diffusion, or
Extraction

The processing of personal data may only be carried out based on one of the following legal bases:

With data subject consent
To comply with a legal or regulatory obligation by the controller
By the public administration, for the processing and shared use of data which are necessary for the execution of public policies provided in laws or regulations or contracts, agreements or similar instruments
For carrying out studies by research entities, ensuring, whenever possible, the anonymization of personal data
For the execution of a contract or preliminary procedures related to a contract to which the data subject is a party
For the regular exercise of rights in judicial, administrative or arbitration procedures
As necessary for the protection of life or physical safety of the data subject or a third party
For the protection of health, exclusively, in a procedure carried out by&nbsp;health professionals, health services or sanitary authorities
To fulfill the legitimate interests of the controller or a third party, except in the case of prevailing the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject, and
For the protection of credit

Notwithstanding the above, personal data processing must be carried out in good faith and based on the following principles:

Purpose
Suitability
Necessity
Free access
Quality of the data
Transparency
Security
Prevention
Nondiscrimination, and
Accountability

As for the processing of sensitive personal data, the processing can only occur when the data subject or their legal representative consents specifically and in highlight, for specific purposes; or, without consent, under the following situations:

As necessary for the controller’s compliance with a legal or regulatory obligation
Shared data processed as necessary for the execution of public policies provided in laws or regulations by the public administration
For carrying out studies by research entities, ensuring, whenever possible, the anonymization of personal data
For the regular exercise of rights, including in a contract or in a judicial, administrative or arbitration procedure
Where necessary for the protection of life or physical safety of the data subject or a third party
The protection of health, exclusively, in a procedure performed by health professionals, health services or sanitary authorities, or
To prevent fraud and protect the safety of the data subject

The controller and operator must keep records of the data processing operations they carry out, mainly when the processing is based on a legitimate interest.
In this sense, the ANPD may determine that the controller must prepare an Impact Report on Protection of Personal Data, including sensitive data, referring to its data processing operations, pursuant to regulations, subject to commercial and industrial secrecy. The report must contain at least a description of the types of data collected, the methodology used for collection and for ensuring the security of the information, and the analysis of the controller regarding the adopted measures, safeguards and mechanisms of risk mitigation.
On August 30, 2021, the ANPD issued a Public Consultation related to a Resolution with special rules on the application of the LGPD to small businesses, startups, and innovative companies. This Resolution includes exemptions and flexibilities, such as the exemption of these companies from maintaining records of data processing activities and flexibility in conducting Data Protection Impact Assessments (“DPIA”). However, this is still a draft Resolution, which must be confirmed and published further.Last modified 24 Jan 2022
