The controller must report to ANPD and the data subject within a reasonable timeframe if the breach is likely to result in risk or harm to data subjects. The LGPD itself does not set a specific deadline for notifying the ANPD in the event of security incidents. However, according to guidance published by the National Authority on February 22, 2021, the communication must be made within two (2) working days, counted from the date of receiving knowledge of the incident.
In addition, according to this guideline, the company or person responsible for the data must internally assess the incident and ascertain the nature, category, and number of data subjects affected. The National Authority must also be communicated in the event of relevant risk or damage to data subjects, using a form available on the ANPD’s page.
The notice must contain, at least, the following:

Description of the nature of the affected personal data
Information regarding the data subjects involved
Indication of the security measures used
The risks generated by the incident
The reasons for a delay in communication (if any)
The measures that were or will be adopted

Additionally, the ANPD must verify the seriousness of the incident and may, if necessary to safeguard the data subject's rights, order the controller to adopt measures, such as the broad disclosure of the event in communications media, as well as measures to reverse or mitigate the effects of the incident.
On August 30, 2021, the ANPD issued a Public Consultation related to a Resolution with special rules on the application of the LGPD to small businesses, startups, and innovative companies. The Resolution includes exemptions and flexibilities, such as the exemption or flexibility in the communication of security incidents, as well as the flexibility regarding deadlines for responding to data subjects’ requests, for communicating severe security incidents to the ANPD and affected data subjects, and for responding to ANPD’s requests. However, this is still a draft Resolution, which must be confirmed and published further.Last modified 24 Jan 2022
