There are no specific provisions for the collectors of personal data to obtain the prior approval of data subjects for the processing of their personal data. However, when collecting data the controller or the controllerâ€™s representative shall provide the data subject with at least the following information:&nbsp;

the name and address of the controller and of his or her representative, if any;
the purposes of the processing;
the existence of the right to object, by request and free of charge, to the intended processing of data relating to him or her, if it is obtained for the purposes of direct marketing;
whether compliance with the request for information is compulsory or not, as well as what the consequences of the failure to comply are;
taking into account the specific circumstances in which the data is collected, any supporting information, as necessary to ensure fair processing for the data subject, such as:

the recipients or categories of recipients of the data;
whether it is compulsory to reply, and what the possible consequences&nbsp;of the failure to reply are;
the existence of the right to access and rectify the data relating to&nbsp;him or her except where such additional information, taking into&nbsp;account the specific circumstances in which the data is collected is&nbsp;not necessary to guarantee accurate processing.


other information dependent on the specific nature of the processing, as specified by the Authority.&nbsp;

For purposes of processing the information Section 13 of the Data Protection Act is quite instructive. In terms of that Section every data controller or data processor shall ensure that personal information is:

processed in accordance with the right to privacy of the data subject;
processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to any data subject;
collected for explicit, specified and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner incompatible with those purposes;
adequate, relevant, limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which it is processed;
