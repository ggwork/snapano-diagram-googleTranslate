The Constitution mandates the Human Rights Commission (HRC) to enforce a citizen's human rights where they have been violated. The right to privacy, including the right not to have the privacy of one's communication infringed, is a basic human right and, thus, falls within the purview of the HRC. However, the Cyber Security and Monitoring of Interceptions of Communications Centre (CSMICC), established by the Interception of Communications Act, is mandated to, among other things, monitor communications made over telecommunications, radio communications and postal systems and to give technical advice to service providers. The mandate of the CSMICC does not preclude it from monitoring computer-based data for the purposes of enforcing an individual's right to privacy where it is found that such right has been infringed.&nbsp;
Further, the CSMICC also has the duty to oversee the enforcement of the Act to ensure that it is enforced reasonably and with due regard to fundamental human rights and freedoms.Last modified 22 Dec 2021
