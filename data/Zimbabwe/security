Section 18 of the Data Protection Act provides guidelines for the protection of data. It states that to safeguard the security, integrity and confidentiality of the data, the&nbsp;controller or his or her representative, if any, or the processor, shall take the appropriate&nbsp;technical and organisational measures that are necessary to protect data from negligent&nbsp;or unauthorised destruction, negligent loss, unauthorised alteration, or access and any&nbsp;other unauthorised processing of the data.&nbsp;
Further the Section also provides that the Data Protection Authority may issue appropriate standards relating to information security for all or certain categories of processing. Since the enactment of this Act the Data Protection Authority is still to issue any appropriate standards.&nbsp;&nbsp;
