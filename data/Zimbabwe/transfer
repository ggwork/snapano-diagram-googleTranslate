The transfer of data to any other jurisdiction is governed in terms of Part VII of the Data Protection Act under section 28 and 29.
In terms of Section 28 of the Data Protection Act:&nbsp;

a data controller may not transfer personal information about a data subject to a third party who is in a foreign country unless an adequate level of protection is ensured in the country of the recipient or within the recipient international organisation and the data is transferred solely to allow tasks covered by the competence of the controller to be carried out.
The adequacy of the level of protection afforded by the third country or international organisation in question shall be assessed in the light of all the circumstances surrounding a data transfer operation or set of data transfer operations; with particular consideration being given to the nature of the data, the purpose and duration of the proposed processing operation or operations, the recipient third country or recipient international organisation, the laws relating to data protection in force in the third country or international organisation in question and the professional rules and security measures which are complied with in that third country or international organisation.
The Authority shall lay down the categories of processing operations for which and the circumstances in which the transfer of data to countries outside the Republic of Zimbabwe is not authorised.
The Minister responsible for the Cyber security and Monitoring Centre in consultation with the Minister, may give directions on how to implement this section with respect to transfer of personal information outside of Zimbabwe.
