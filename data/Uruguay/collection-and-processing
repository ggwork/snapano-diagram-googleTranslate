In order to collect the information which is contained in the database, the data processor should obtain prior documented consent from the individual or entity whose information is being processed. Documented consent is not required in the following cases:

personal data obtained from public sources;
personal data obtained by public bodies to comply with legal obligations;
personal data limited to domicile, telephone number, ID number, nationality, tax number, corporation name;
personal data obtained in base of a contractual or professional relationship, which is necessary to perform the contract or the development of the professional services to be rendered; and
personal data obtained by individuals or corporations for their personal and exclusive use.

The personal data processed cannot be used for purposes different from those that have justified the acquisition of the information. It is understood that legitimate reasons (i.e. reasons which are not against the law) must pre exist and underlay the processing of the personal information. The Data Protection Act further establishes that once the reasons to process the personal information have disappeared, the personal information must be deleted.Last modified 15 Feb 2022
