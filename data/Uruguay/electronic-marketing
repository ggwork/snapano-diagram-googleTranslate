The Act will apply to most electronic marketing activities, as these activities likely involve the processing and use of personal data (e.g. an email address is likely to be "personal data" for the purposes of the Act). The Act does not prohibit the use of personal data for the purposes of electronic marketing but grants personal data owners with the right to demand the elimination or blocking of their data from the data base.
Personal data can be used and processed for marketing purposes when it has been taken from public documents, when it has been provided by the personal data owner or when prior consent has been gathered.Last modified 15 Feb 2022
