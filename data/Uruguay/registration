The Uruguayan legal system requires the registration of all databases containing personal data of individuals or legal entities (Articles 24, 28, and 29 of the Act and Articles 15 to 20 of the Decree 414/009).
The Law applies when the processing of personal data is performed by controllers located in Uruguay.
The Act has extraterritorial effects in the following cases:

if the activities are related to the offer of goods or services to individuals residing in Uruguay, or intended to monitor their behaviour;
if private international laws or contractual agreements so establish it; and
if the processing is made by using means located in Uruguay, with the exceptions of the cases in which those means are used for the sole purpose of transit, and there is a person responsible for the processing with residency in Uruguay, appointed by the controller before the URCDP.

The register must be updated every three months (Article 20 of the Decree 414/009).Last modified 15 Feb 2022
