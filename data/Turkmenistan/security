Article 23 of the Data Protection Law stipulates that data operators shall implement a set of legal, organizational and technical measures to ensure personal data protection. Such measures shall:&nbsp;

Uphold the rights to privacy, personal and family secrets
Ensure integrity and security of personal data
Confidentiality of personal data
Allow owner of personal data to have guaranteed access to such personal data
Prevent unauthorised collection and processing of personal data&nbsp;

Data operators are statutorily obliged to take any necessary and lawful measures to protect personal data and ensure:

Prevention of unauthorized access to personal data
Timely detection of unauthorized access to personal information
No adverse effects of such unauthorized access to personal data&nbsp;

It is important to note that the obligation of the data operators, as well as any third party acquiring the personal data, to protect confidentiality of the acquired personal data, arises from the moment such data is collected and shall be effective until the moment such data is destroyed or depersonalized.Last modified 25 Jan 2021
