Data Protection Law does not provide for any provisions regarding breach notification requirements. In other words, data operators are not obliged to notify the owners of personal data regarding any identified or potential confidentiality breach. However, the Data Protection Law envisages that data operators are obliged to block any personal data within one working day, if there is risk that a breach occurred.Last modified 25 Jan 2021
