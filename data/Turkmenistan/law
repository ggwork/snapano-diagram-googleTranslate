The Law of Turkmenistan No.519-V ‘On Information about Private Life and its Protection’ (the ‘Data Protection Law’) is the main and only law governing matters relating to collection and processing of personal data in Turkmenistan.&nbsp;
The Data Protection Law was enacted on 20 March 2017, ie after the adoption of the General Data Protection Regulation (the ‘GDPR’) and entered into force on 1 July 2017. In fact, the Data Protection Law partly reflects the rules and principles perpetuated in the GDPR. However, the similarities that can be discovered between the Data Protection Law and the GDPR are few and in most cases the Data Protection Law implements the simplified approach suggested by the GDPR.Last modified 25 Jan 2021
