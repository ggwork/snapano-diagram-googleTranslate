For the purposes of cross-border transfers of personal data, the relevant consent of owner of personal data is required. Since the Data Protection Law does not stipulate on whether this should be a separate consent, it is recommended to obtain such consent together with a general consent on collection and processing of personal data.&nbsp;
Please note that personal data transferred outside Turkmenistan shall also be stored in the territory of Turkmenistan. Personal data processed for the purpose of statistical and/or scientific analysis shall be de-personalized.&nbsp;
Data operator is not allowed to transfer personal data outside Turkmenistan to a third party by virtue of a contract on collection and/or processing of personal data.Last modified 25 Jan 2021
