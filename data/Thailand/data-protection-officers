Data Controllers and Data Processors are only required to appoint a data protection officer (DPO) if it qualifies as any of the following:

is a public authority as prescribed and announced by the Regulator;
requires regular monitoring of Personal Data or system due to the collection, use or disclosure of large amount of Personal Data as prescribed by the Regulator; or
the core activity of the Data Controller or the Data Processor involves the collection, use, or disclosure of Sensitive Personal Data.

According to the public hearing guidelines that have been issued, large amount of Personal Data refers to: (i) Personal Data of &gt;50,000 data subjects or Sensitive Personal Data of &gt;5,000 data subjects within a 12 months period; (ii) a Data Controller or Data Processor having more than 20 staffs dealing with the collection, use and disclosure of Personal Data; or (iii) a Data Controller or Data Processor having more than 20 branches or places dealing with the collection, use and disclosure of Personal Data. Note that the public hearing guidelines intend to only propose the potential direction the subordinate regulations are likely to take and are not draft regulations which are binding.Last modified 13 Jan 2022
