It is expected that, prior to 1 June 2022, the Regulator will issue guidelines to assist Data Controllers' compliance plans. In the meantime, to ensure compliance with the data protection law, public organisations and business operators should start to comply with the PDPA by evaluating the level of data protection measures adopted by its organisation against the standards of the PDPA, and ensure that the necessary documentation required by the PDPA are prepared. &nbsp;
There are three types of penalties under the PDPA â€“ civil, criminal and administrative penalties. The amount of penalty will depend on the offence committed. The maximum administrative fine is THB 5,000,000. Punitive damages may also be awarded by the court but this is limited to twice the amount of actual compensation. In the event that the offender is a juristic person, the director, manager or the responsible person may also be criminally liable under the PDPA if the relevant offence(s) resulted from such person's order, action or omission. It is unclear at this early stage what direction the Regulator will take in terms of actual enforcement.
Data Processors who do not comply with their obligations are liable to an administrative fine under the PDPA. There may also be liability under tort law.Last modified 13 Jan 2022
