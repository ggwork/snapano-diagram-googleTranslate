The Data Controller may not use or disclose Personal Data without consent unless it has been exempted from the consent requirement (i.e. on the grounds of other legal bases of processing). The recipient of the Personal Data must not disclose the Personal Data for any other purposes other than as previously notified to the Data Controller when requesting for the Personal Data.
In the event that the Data Controller uses or discloses Personal Data which is exempt from the consent requirement (i.e. other legal basis of processing), the Data Controller must maintain a record of such use or disclosure in the manner prescribed under the PDPA, for example the record must be kept in a written or electronic format.
Processing between Data Controllers and Data Processors
As the Data Processor will be carrying out activities only pursuant to the instructions given by the Data Controller, the PDPA imposes an obligation on the Data Controller to ensure that there is a data processing agreement in place between the Data Controller and Data Processor governing the activities of the Data Processor.&nbsp;
Cross-Border Transfer
Personal Data may not be transferred outside of Thailand, unless the recipient country or international organisation has adequate personal data protection standards in the Regulatorâ€™s view and the transfer is in accordance with the rules prescribed by the Regulator. Exemptions may apply such as in the following cases:

the data subject has given consent and proper notification has been given by the Data Controller;
the transfer is necessary for the performance of a contract between the Data Controller and data subject; or
the transfer is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject.&nbsp;

Transfer between group companies may be exempt from the above requirement if the international transfer is to an organisation within the same group/affiliated business and such transfer is for joint business operations. Nevertheless, the personal data protection policy of such group companies must be approved by the Regulator.&nbsp;
The transfer requirements may have an impact on multinational organisations that routinely transfer data cross border. However, given that many organisations in Europe will already comply with similar (and likely more stringent) data protection laws, the impact of the PDPA may be limited regarding cross-border transfer of data.Last modified 13 Jan 2022
