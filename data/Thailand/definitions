Data Controller is defined as "a person or juristic person who determines the purposes for which and the manner in which any personal data are, or are to be processed." Data Controllers have primary responsibility for ensuring that processing activities are compliant with the PDPA.
Data Processor is defined as "a person or an entity that collects, uses, or discloses personal data on behalf of, or in accordance with, the instructions of a Data Controller." Data Processors have direct liability under the PDPA in areas such as (this is not exhaustive) data security, data transfer and record keeping.
Personal Data is defined as "any data pertaining to a person that enables the identification of that person, whether directly or indirectly, but specifically excluding data of the deceased."
Sensitive Personal Data is defined as "personal data relating to a personâ€™s race, ethnicity, political opinion, cult, religious or philosophical beliefs, sexual behaviour, criminal records, health, disability, labour union, genetics, biometric or any data which may affect the data subject in the same way as prescribed by the Regulator." The PDPA requires Sensitive Personal Data to be handled carefully. We expect the Regulator to provide further guidance on this in due course.Last modified 13 Jan 2022
