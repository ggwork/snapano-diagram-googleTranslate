The Federal Law on the Protection of Personal Data held by Private Parties (Ley Federal de Protección de Datos Personales en Posesión de los Particulares) ("the Law") entered into force on July 6, 2010.
Subsequently, the Executive Branch has also issued the following (collectively, with the Law, referred to herein as "Mexican Privacy Laws"):

The Regulations to the Federal Law on the Protection of Personal Data held by Private Parties (Reglamento de la Ley Federal de Protección de Datos Personales en Posesión de los Particulares) (the Regulations), which entered into force on December 22, 2011
The Privacy Notice Guidelines (the Guidelines), which entered into force on April 18, 2013
The Recommendations on Personal Data Security, on November 30, 2013
The Parameters for Self-Regulation regarding personal data, which entered into force on May 30, 2014
The General Law for the Protection of Personal Data in Possession of Obligated Subjects (Ley General de Protección de Datos Personales en Posesión de Sujetos Obligados), which entered into force on January 27, 2017

On June 12, 2018, a decree was published in the Official Gazette of the Federation approving two important documents:

Convention for the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data dated January 28, 1981, and its
Additional Protocol regarding supervisory authorities and trans-border data flows dated November 8, 2001.

Mexican Privacy Laws apply to all personal data processing under any of the following circumstances:

Processing carried out by a data controller established in Mexican territory
Processing carried out by a data processor, regardless of its location, if the processing is performed on behalf of a data controller established in Mexico
Processing by or on behalf of a data controller not located in Mexico, where Mexican legislation is applicable pursuant to the execution of an agreement or Mexico’s adherence to an international convention or
Processing carried out within Mexican territory, on behalf of a data controller not established in Mexican territory, unless such processing is only for transit purposes

The Law only applies to private individuals or legal entities that process personal data, and not to the government, credit reporting companies governed by the Law Regulating Credit Reporting Companies or persons carrying out the collection and storage of personal data exclusively for personal use where it is not disclosed for commercial use. Further, Mexican Privacy Law also does not generally apply to business-to-business data, including:

Data of legal entities.
Data of individuals acting as merchants or professionals.
Data of natural persons acting on behalf of a business (e.g., their employer), where the personal data processed is (a) limited to first and last names, title, position and functions performed, and business contact data, such as mailing or physical address, email address, telephone number and fax number, and (b) the personal data is processed solely for the purpose of representing the business or administering the business relationship (i.e., fulfilling orders, providing services, carrying out transactions between the business entities)
