All data controllers must establish and maintain physical, technical and administrative security measures designed to protect personal data from damage, loss, alteration, destruction or unauthorized use, access or processing. They may not adopt security measures that are inferior to those they have in place to manage their own information.
The risk involved, potential consequences for the data subjects, sensitivity of the data and technological development must be taken into account when establishing security measures, and more care should be taken in the collection and process of sensitive personal data.
The Controller also has the obligation to train its personnel on the proper handling of personal data in order to ensure compliance with the Mexican Privacy Laws. Per the Guidelines, a controller must also establish, document and follow security policies and procedures, including:

Maintaining an inventory of personal data and the relevant processing systems, and update this at least once per year with respect to sensitive personal data
Identifying the duties and obligations of persons that processing personal data on behalf of the controller
Conducting appropriate risk analyses to identify dangers and estimate risk of harm to personal data
Establishing security measures applicable and confirm they are effectively implemented
Assessing and improving security on an ongoing basis
Establishing a roadmap to implement any missing security measures identified pursuant to a security breach (as necessary to prevent a recurrence of such breach)
Performing reviews or audits of security program
Maintaining records of the storage means for personal data
