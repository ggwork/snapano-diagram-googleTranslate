Security breaches occurring at any stage of the processing that materially affect the property or moral rights of the data subject must be promptly reported by the data controller to the data subject.
Under Mexican Privacy Laws, a security breach of personal data includes any unauthorized:

loss or destruction of personal data
theft, loss or copying of personal data
use, access or processing of personal data
damage or alteration of personal data

If there is a breach of personal data, the controller must first analyze the causes of such breach; and then take steps to implement any corrective, preventive, improvement actions necessary to prevent the breach from recurring.
If a breach significantly affects the property or moral rights of the data subjects, the controller must immediately notify the affected data subjects, as soon as it confirms that the breach has occurred, so that the affected Data Subjects can take the corresponding measures.
The Regulations provide that breach notification must include at least the following information:

The nature of the breach
The personal data compromised
Recommendations to the data subject concerning measures that he or she can adopt to protect his or her interests
Immediate corrective actions implemented in response to the breach, and
The means by which the data subject may obtain more information in regard to the data breach
