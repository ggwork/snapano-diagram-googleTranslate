There are some articles in the Act No 4 (1990) on the National System for Information and Documentation, which governs the governmentâ€™s collection of personal data for conducting research for social and economic reasons. This Act provides some provisions which require government entities to take some steps to protect the collected data, such as prohibiting the government from forcing individuals to give their data in order to conduct its research. However, these articles do not provide protection to personal data when individuals process their data. &nbsp;Also, the Central Bank of Libya regulated general criteria for protecting personal data which is available online. However, this is applicable to only Libyan banks.Last modified 16 Feb 2022
