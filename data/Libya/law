Currently, there is no data protection law in Libya. However, Articles 12 and 13 of the Constitution 2011 guarantee the right to a private life for citizens and the confidentiality of correspondence, telephonic conversations and other forms of communications except where required by a judicial warrant respectively. In other words, there is no detailed information concerning privacy systems in Libya that protect individuals when their data is processed. With regard to privacy protection, there are some provisions in the Libyan Penal Code (1953) that provide general protection for private correspondence and homes from any interference by others. These articles provide that the public servants who commit an offence against private correspondence will face imprisonment of no less than six months.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, there are some articles in the Act No 4 (1990) on the National System for Information and Documentation, which governs the governmentâ€™s collection of personal data for conducting research for social and economic reasons. This Act provides some provisions which require government entities to take some steps to protect the collected data, such as prohibiting the government from forcing individuals to give their data in order to conduct its research. However, these articles do not provide protection to personal data when individuals process their data. &nbsp;Also, the Central Bank of Libya regulated general criteria for protecting personal data which is available online. However, this is applicable to only Libyan banks.Last modified 16 Feb 2022
