A personal data processor may transfer data to a foreign country if the receiving country ensures an adequate level of protection for the privacy and human rights and freedoms of the persons concerned.&nbsp;
The level of protection will be assessed according to:&nbsp;

the data protection laws of the recipient country;
the safety measures; and
the processing characteristics (end, duration, nature, origin, destination of processed data).&nbsp;

It is worth noting that a country may not provide sufficient data protection, but if a recipient country is not deemed 'safe' in protecting data, but a data transfer is followed by protective measures such as contractual clauses or internal rules, assent could be provided by the APDP.&nbsp;
For instance, some data, such as biometric data, health data, data related to serious infringements, and data regarding crime, will be considered as involving specific risks for human rights and freedom of individuals' data. These data will need to be approved under Article 41 of the Law on the Protection of Personally Identifiable Information.Last modified 10 Jan 2022
