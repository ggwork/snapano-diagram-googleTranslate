According to the Article 430 of the Digital Code, a Data Protection Officer (DPO) must be appointed when the data controller is a state-owned organisation or when the activities of the data controller or data processor involve monitoring individuals or processing of sensitive data on a large scale.&nbsp;
Although the Digital Code does not impose a strict duty for the appointment of a DPO, organisations with a DPO are exempt from notifying the APDP of data processing (Article 408 of the Digital Code).Last modified 10 Jan 2022
