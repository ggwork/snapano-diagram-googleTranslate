Definition of Personal Data
Personal Data is defined as any information relating to an individual which helps identifying such individual, either directly or indirectly, including by way of comparing or combining information of multiple sources.
Definition of Sensitive Personal Data
The Law brings no definition of sensitive personal data per se. However, it states that the processing of personal data falling within specific categories shall only be processed under a license from the Ministry of Economy and Trade (exceptions apply).
The Law does not attribute a particular name for such category of data, simply listing specific data elements falling within the above defined category, as follows:&nbsp;&nbsp;

those related to the external and internal security of the State, under the terms of a joint decision of the Ministers of National Defence and Interior and Municipalities;
those related to criminal offences and judicial proceedings of various natures, under the terms of a decision by the Minister of Justice;
those related to health, genetic identity, sexual life of individuals, under the terms of a decision of the Minister of Public Health.
