Pursuant to the Data Protection Law, before starting the processing of personal data (and considering the specific categories of personal data), prior authorization or registration with the data protection authority is required.
Specific prior written registration (ie authorization) granted by the data protection authority is necessary in the following cases:

the processing of sensitive data (except in certain specific cases eg if the processing relates to data which is manifestly made public by the data subject, provided his consent for such processing can be clearly inferred from his/her statements) and only in cases where the data subject has given his/her consent to the use of such data


the processing of data in relation to creditworthiness or solvency


the interconnection of personal data


the use of personal data for purposes other than those for which it was initially collected.
