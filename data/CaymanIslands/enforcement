A breach of the DPA constitutes a criminal offence, punishable on conviction to a fine of up to CI$100,000 (approx. US$125,000), imprisonment for a term of up to 5 years, or both.&nbsp;
In addition, the DPA empowers the Ombudsman to issue monetary penalty orders of up to CI$250,000 (approx. US$300,000) where the Ombudsman is satisfied on a balance of probabilities that there has been a serious contravention of the law by a data controller and the contravention was of a kind likely to cause substantial damage or substantial distress to a data subject.
Investigative and corrective powers
The Ombudsman is given wide investigative and corrective powers under the DPA, including to require the provision of information and to issue orders to carry out specific remediation activities.
Right to claim compensation
The DPA specifically provides for individuals to bring private claims against data controllers: any person who suffers damage by reason of a contravention by a data controller of any requirement of the DPA has a cause of action for compensation from the data controller for that damage.
Personal liability
The DPA explicitly provides for personal liability for offences committed by a body corporate where the offence is proven to have been committed with the consent or connivance of, or to be attributable to any neglect on the part of, any director, secretary or similar officer or any person purporting to act in such capacity.&nbsp; Where the affairs of a body corporate are managed by its members, this personal liability also applies to the acts and defaults of a member in connection with the member's functions of management.Last modified 24 Jan 2022
