The Data Protection Act (2021 revision) (DPA) is a Cayman Islands law, which first came into force on 30 September 2019.&nbsp; The DPL introduced the first legislative framework on data protection in the Cayman Islands.&nbsp;
Application
The application of the DPA turns on whether an organization is established in the Cayman Islands or has personal data processed in the Cayman Islands.&nbsp; Specifically, the DPA applies to a data controller in respect of personal data only if:

the data controller is established in the Cayman Islands and the personal data are processed in the context of that establishment; or
the data controller is not established in the Cayman Islands, but the personal data are processed in the Cayman Islands other than for the purposes of transit of the data through the Cayman Islands.

For these purposes, 'established in the Cayman Islands' means:

a body incorporated, or a partnership or other unincorporated association formed, under the laws of the Cayman Islands;
a body registered as a foreign company under the laws of the Cayman Islands;
an individual who is ordinarily resident in the Cayman Islands; or
any other person who maintains (i) an office, branch or agency in the Cayman Islands through which the person carries on any activity; or (ii) a regular practice in the Cayman Islands.

A data controller not established in the Cayman Islands that processes personal data in the Cayman Islands is required to appoint a local representative established in the Cayman Islands who, for all purposes within the Cayman Islands, is the data controller and bears all obligations under the DPA as if it were the data controller.Last modified 24 Jan 2022
