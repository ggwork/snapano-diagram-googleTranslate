The DPA applies to most electronic marketing activities as these will involve some use of personal data (e.g., an email address which includes the recipient's name).&nbsp; The most plausible legal bases for electronic marketing will be consent or the legitimate interests of the data controller.&nbsp; Where consent is relied upon, the strict standards for consent under the DPA are to be noted, and marketing consent forms will invariably need to incorporate clearly worded opt-in mechanisms (such as the ticking of an unticked consent box, or the signing of a statement, and not merely the acceptance of terms and conditions, or consent implied from conduct, such as visiting a website).
Data subjects have an unconditional right to require a data controller at any time to cease (or not to begin) processing their personal data for the purposes of direct marketing (which includes direct electronic marketing).Last modified 24 Jan 2022
