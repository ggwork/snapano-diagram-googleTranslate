The DPA defines 'personal data' as data relating to a living individual who can be identified, including data such as:

the living individual's location data or online identifier;
factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of the living individual;
an expression of opinion about the living individual; and
any indications of the intentions of the data controller or any other person in respect of the living individual.

The DPA creates more restrictive rules for the processing of 'sensitive personal data', which includes personal data consisting of a data subject's racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious beliefs, trade union membership, genetic data, physical or mental health or condition, medical data, sex life or commission or alleged commission of an offence or related proceedings.
Under the DPA the 'processing' of personal data has an extremely broad meaning and includes obtaining, recording or holding data, or carrying out any operation on personal data.
Personal data may be processed by either a data controller or a data processor.&nbsp; The data controller is the decision maker, the person who 'alone or jointly with others determines the purposes, conditions and manner in which any personal data are, or are to be, processed'.&nbsp; The data processor 'processes personal data on behalf of a data controller'.&nbsp; The obligations under the DPA are imposed almost exclusively on the data controller.&nbsp;
A 'data subject' is an identified living individual or a living individual who can be identified directly or indirectly by means reasonably likely to be used by the data controller or by any other person.Last modified 24 Jan 2022
