The DPA is not prescriptive about specific technical standards or measures that must be taken to protect personal data.&nbsp; Rather, the DPA adopts a context-specific approach, requiring that appropriate technical and organization measures be taken, appropriate to the risks presented by the processing.&nbsp; A data controller should take into account the state of the art, costs of implementation, as well as the nature, scope, context and purpose of their processing.
Aspects to consider include:

organizational measures, e.g. staff training and policy development;
technical measures, e.g. physical protection of data, pseudonymization, encryption; and
securing ongoing availability, integrity and accessibility, e.g. by ensuring backups.
