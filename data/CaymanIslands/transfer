As set out in the eighth principle, transfers of personal data by a data controller or a data processor to countries or territories outside the Cayman Islands are only permitted where that country or territory ensures an adequate level of protection for the rights and freedoms of data subjects in relation to the processing of personal data.&nbsp; This is to ensure that the level of protection provided by the DPA is not circumvented by transferring personal data abroad.
The Ombudsman has issued guidance stating that it considers the following countries and territories as ensuring an adequate level of protection:

member states of the European Economic Area (that is, the European Union plus Lichtenstein, Norway and Iceland) where Regulation EU 2016/679 (the General Data Protection Regulation or "GDPR") is applicable; and
any country or territory in respect of which an adequacy decision has been adopted by the European Commission pursuant to Article 45(3) GDPR or remains in force pursuant to Article 45(9) of the GDPR.

Other countries and territories may be deemed to have an adequate level of protection depending on various factors, which are to be assessed by a data controller, or a data controller may request authorization from the Ombudsman for a transfer.
The DPA also includes the following exceptions where the eighth principle will not apply to a transfer:

if the data subject has consented to the transfer (where consent must be freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous and must be capable of being withdrawn at any time);
where the transfer is necessary for the performance of a contract between the data subject and the data controller, or the taking of steps at the request of the data subject with a view to the data subject's entering into a contract with the data controller;
the transfer is necessary for the conclusion of a contract between the data controller and a person other than the data subject, being a contract that is entered into at the request of the data subject, or is in the interests of the data subject, or for the performance of such a contract;
the transfer is necessary for reasons of substantial public interest;
the transfer is necessary for the purposes of legal proceedings, obtaining legal advice or otherwise establishing, exercising or defending legal rights;
the transfer is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject;
the transfer is part of the personal data on a public register and any conditions subject to which the register is open to inspection are complied with by a person to whom the data are or may be disclosed after the transfer; or
the transfer is required under international cooperation arrangements between intelligence agencies or between regulatory agencies to combat organized crime, terrorism or drug trafficking or to carry out other cooperative functions, to the extent permitted or required under Cayman Islands law or an order of the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands.
