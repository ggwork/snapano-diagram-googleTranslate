Data Protection Officers (“DPOs”) are mandatory for:

DIFC Bodies (as defined under the DPL, other than courts acting in their judicial capacity); and
a Controller or Processor performing high risk Processing activities on a systematic or regular basis.

A Controller or Processor could also be required to appoint a DPO by the Commissioner.
A Group (defined under DPL) may appoint a single DPO provided that he is easily accessible to each entity in the Group. The DPO must reside in the UAE unless he is an individual employed within the organisation's Group and performs a similar function for the Group on an international basis.
In addition, if a Controller or Processor is not required to appoint a DPO, it must still clearly allocate responsibility for oversight and compliance with respect to data protection duties and obligations and provide details to the Commissioner (i.e. the person appointed, pursuant to the DPL, to monitor, ensure and enforce compliance with the DPL).
