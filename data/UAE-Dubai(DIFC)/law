In July 2020 the Dubai International Financial Centre ("DIFC") brought DPL No. 5 of 2020 (“DPL”) into effect, giving companies a three month transition period to update their compliance programs before it became enforceable on 1 October 2020. The DPL replaced the existing DIFC data protection law (which was last updated in 2012), bringing it more closely in line with global privacy standards, such as the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679.
In addition, alongside the DPL a new set of accompanying Data Protection Regulations (“DPRs”) were introduced.Last modified 21 Jan 2021
