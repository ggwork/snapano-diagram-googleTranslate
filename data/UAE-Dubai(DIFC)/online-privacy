Where a Controller is offering online services through a platform, the default privacy preferences of the platform must be set such that no more than the minimum Personal Data necessary to deliver or receive the relevant services is obtained or collected, and a Data Subject should be:

prompted to actively select his privacy preferences on first use; and
able to easily change such preferences.

(Article 14(4) DPL)
In addition, Controllers are to make available a minimum of two methods (which may include, by way of example, post, telephone, email or an online form) by which a Data Subject can contact the Controller to request to exercise his rights under the DPL. If the Controller maintains a website, at least one method of contact must be made available without charge via the website, without the need to submit data to create an account of any sort.
