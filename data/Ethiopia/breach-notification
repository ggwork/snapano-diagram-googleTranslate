There is no general breach notification requirement in Ethiopia.&nbsp;
However, the Computer Crime Proclamation No. 958/2016 requires service providers with knowledge that a crime stipulated by the Proclamation (including breach of privacy via unauthorized access) has been committed by a third party through the computer system it administers to immediately notify the Information Network Security Agency, report the crime to police, and take appropriate measures.
Ethiopian Communications Authority’s Sim Card Registration Directive under Article 24 obliges a telecommunication operator to notify the Ethiopian Communications Authority of any data breach that compromises subscribers’ information within seven (7) business days from discovery of the breach. The operator shall also notify the affected subscriber of such breach.Last modified 20 Dec 2021
