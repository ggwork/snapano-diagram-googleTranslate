With certain exceptions (discussed below), there is no requirement under PDP Law to notify or register before processing personal data.&nbsp;
The registration requirement applies to the databases. According to the PDP Law, a database is any structured set of personal data where data is arranged and can be accessed based on certain criteria. The PDP Law uses the term filing system to denote a database.&nbsp; For example, a customer database or a registry of employees and clients that is subject to processing may qualify as a filing system.&nbsp;
The data controller is obliged to have a catalogue on each filing system that provides a detailed description of the filing system's structure and content.&nbsp;
According to the PDP Law, before creating a filing system and entering in any new category of data, a data controller shall notify the State Inspector and register the following information about the filing system:&nbsp;

The name;
The names and addresses of a data controller and a data processor;
The place of storing or processing of data;
The legal grounds for data processing;
The category or categories of data subjects;
The data category or categories in a filing system;
The purpose of data processing;
The period of data storage;
The facts and grounds for restriction (if any) of any data subject rights;
The recipient of data stored in a filing system, and their categories;
Information on any cross-border data transfer and transmission of data to international organisation and the legal grounds for the transfer;
A general description of the procedure established to ensure data safety.&nbsp;

The data controller shall regularly update the filing system catalogue and notify the Inspector about any alteration made to the information, no later than 30 days after the alteration.&nbsp;
The notification requirement also applies to cross-border data transfer and a private organisation's processing of a biometric data.&nbsp;
Before using the biometric data, a data controller must provide the State Inspector with the same information that is provided to the data subject, specifically the purpose of data processing and the security measures taken to protect the data.Last modified 22 Dec 2021
