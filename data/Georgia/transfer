Transfer of personal data outside Georgia is admissible without a separate authorisation from the State Inspector if one of the two following conditions apply:&nbsp;

A respective legal ground for data processing exists and the proper standards for the safety of data are secured in the relevant country. The State Inspector has approved the list of such countries;
The processing of data is stipulated under an international agreement between Georgia and the relevant country;&nbsp;

However, the general data processing rules will still apply, including securing a necessary legal ground such as the data subject's consent and the requirements of proportionality and necessity.&nbsp;
If neither of these conditions apply, then there should be a formal written agreement between the transferor and the data's recipient under which the data's recipient shall commit to ensure proper guarantees to protect the data. In this case, the State Inspector must be presented with such agreement and other relevant information or documents for data transfer approval.&nbsp;Last modified 22 Dec 2021
