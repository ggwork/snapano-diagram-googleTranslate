An organization must have appropriate security measures in place (ie, 'take reasonable steps) to protect any personal information it retains from misuse and loss and from unauthorized access, modification or disclosure. The Privacy Commissioner has issued detailed guidance on what it considers to be reasonable steps in the context of security of personal information, which we recommend be reviewed and implemented. Depending on the organization, and how and by which government agency it is regulated, as noted above specific requirements or expectations may also exist and with which organizations should be familiar. An organization must also take reasonable steps to destroy or permanently de-identify personal information if it is no longer needed for the purpose(s) for which it was collected.Last modified 23 Dec 2021
