The sending of electronic marketing (referred to as 'commercial electronic messages' in Australia) is regulated under the Spam Act 2003 (Cth) (“Spam Act”) and enforced by the Australian Communications and Media Authority.
Under the Spam Act, a commercial electronic message (which includes emails and SMS’s sent for marketing purposes) must not be sent without the prior opt-in consent of the recipient.
In addition, each electronic message (which the recipient has consented to receive) must identify the sender and contain a functional unsubscribe facility to enable the recipient to opt out of receiving future electronic marketing. Requests to unsubscribe must be processed within 5 business days.
A failure to comply with the Spam Act (including unsubscribing a recipient that uses the unsubscribe facility) may have costly consequences, with repeat offenders facing penalties of up to AU$2.1 million per day.Last modified 23 Dec 2021
