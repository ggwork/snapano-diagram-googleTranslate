Traffic data
Traffic Data must be erased or made anonymous as soon as it is no longer needed for the purpose of the transmission of a communication, except in cases where a longer period of retention is statutory allowed. Nevertheless, an operator may, until complete payment for service is made but no later than by expiry of the limitation period, retain and process traffic data required for the purposes of calculation and of payment relating to interconnection.
Location data
Location Data may only be processed for the purposes of providing the value-added service and when it is made anonymous, or with the prior consent of the user or subscriber, who may withdraw this consent at any time. Prior to issuing consent, a user or subscriber must be informed on (i) the possibility of refusing consent, (ii) the type of data to be processed, (iii) the purpose and duration of processing, and (iv) the possibility of the transmission of location data to a third party for the purpose of providing the value-added service.
Cookie compliance
The Electronic Communications Act (ZEKom-1) provides rules on the usage of cookies and similar technology for data storage.
Pursuant to ZEKom-1 the retention of information or the gaining of access to information stored in a subscriber’s or user’s terminal equipment (cookies) is only permitted if the subscriber or user gave their informed consent after having been given clear and comprehensive information about the information manager and the purpose of the processing of this information. However, an exception is provided in case of carrying out the transmission of a communication over an electronic communications network, or if this is strictly necessary for provision of service of information society explicitly requested by the subscriber or user.
In the near future, it is to be expected that the new ZEKom-2 will come in force and provide further regulation of the realm at hand.Last modified 17 Jan 2022
