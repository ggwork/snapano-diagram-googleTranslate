The Data Protection Law does not provide any legal requirement to appoint a data protection officer (délégué à la protection des données à caractère personnel) in Madagascar.
However, an entity is exempt from making prior declarations to the CMIL if the entity has appointed a data protection officer ('DPO').
The appointment of a DPO does not exempt an entity from requesting prior authorisation, where necessary (for example where there is a transfer of data to a country that does not provide an adequate level of protection for personal data).
The DPO must be a resident of Madagascar.Last modified 25 Jan 2017
