Once fully in force, PIPA will require notification of a breach of security leading to the loss or unlawful destruction or unauthorised disclosure of, or access to, personal information which is likely to adversely affect an individual to (a) the individual concerned; and (b) the Privacy Commissioner.&nbsp;
The notice to the Commissioner must describe the nature of the breach, its likely consequences for the individual concerned, and the measures the organisation is taking to address the breach.Last modified 24 Jan 2022
