Once fully in force, PIPA will regulate the transfer of personal information to an overseas third party. The legislation provides that the Privacy Commissioner can designate jurisdictions as providing comparable protection to Bermuda law. In other cases, the organisation subject to PIPA will be required to employ contractual mechanisms, corporate codes of conduct or other means to ensure that the overseas third party provides comparable protection for the personal information.Last modified 24 Jan 2022
