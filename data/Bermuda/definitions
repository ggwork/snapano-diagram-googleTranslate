Definition of use
PIPA applies to the "use" of personal information, and defines "use" as carrying out any operation on personal information, including collecting, obtaining, recording, holding, storing, organising, adapting, altering, retrieving, transferring, consulting, disclosing, disseminating or otherwise making available, combining, blocking, erasing or destroying it.
Definition of personal data

At common law, information is generally to be regarded as 'confidential' if it has a necessary quality of confidentiality and has been communicated or has become known in such circumstances as give rise to a reasonable expectation of confidence; for example if obtained in connection with certain professional relationships, if obtained by improper means, or if received from another party who is subject to a duty of confidentiality.
Definition of sensitive personal data
PIPA provides for a definition of "sensitive personal information" as meaning "any personal information relating to an individualâ€™s place of origin, race, colour, national or ethnic origin, sex, sexual orientation, sexual life, marital status, physical or mental disability, physical or mental health, family status, religious beliefs, political opinions, trade union membership, biometric information or genetic information".&nbsp;Last modified 24 Jan 2022
