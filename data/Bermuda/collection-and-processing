Once fully in force, PIPA will regulate the collection and processing of personal information and will apply to any individual, entity or public authority collecting, storing and using personal information in Bermuda either electronically or as part of a structured filing system. The use to which sensitive personal information can be put by an organisation is much more restrictive.
The common law, which will continue to apply in parallel with PIPA, will in certain cases consider it a breach of confidence to misuse or threaten to misuse confidential information.  The concept of 'misuse' is a broad one, but will often include any unauthorised disclosure, examination, copying or taking of confidential information.  The precise scope of the term however will depend largely on the specific circumstances, including the relevant relationship and the nature of the information.Last modified 24 Jan 2022
