Data Protection Law obliges operators to designate a structural unit or person responsible for the internal control of personal data processing. This shall be an internal unit or employees of the organisation, i.e. it is not possible to outsource the control functions. The legislation does not provide mandatory requirements for the person responsible for the internal control. Consequently, the operator appoints such a person or structural unit at its discretion.
Persons responsible for the internal control of personal data processing shall complete training on issues related to personal data protection at least once every five years. Depending on the type of organisation, the training may be organised at NPDPC or other educational organisations. In addition, the operators shall annually by 15&nbsp;November provide NPDPC with information on the number of persons who shall complete training at NPDPC.Moreover, a legal entity, including state body, processing personal data shall create information protection systems to secure information in their information systems used for processing of such data. As a part of creation of such system the entity should establish special department or appoint employee responsible to take required technical and cryptography information protection measures. According to the amendments to the Information Protection Decree, the employees of such department (responsible employee) are required to have higher education in the sphere of information protection security or other higher or professional-technical education and undergo training on the issues of technical and cryptographic information protection.
If for some reasons respective departments / employees cannot take such measures themselves, a special organisation licensed to perform activities on technical and / or cryptography information protection may be involved.
