Data Protection Law establishes an obligation to notify National Personal Data Protection Center on breach of systems used for personal data protection immediately, but not later than within three days of discovery in writing or in the form of an electronic document. Exceptions to this requirement are cases where a breach of security systems has not resulted in the unlawful dissemination, provision of personal data; modification, blocking or deletion of personal data without the possibility of restoring access to it.
Certain additional requirements on the notification of the OAC are set for specific cases of information protection system breaches or periodical reporting as required by Belarus law. The respective requirements are set forth in the Regulations on the procedure for submitting information about information security events, the state of technical and cryptographic protection of information to the OAC, as approved by the Order of the OAC of 2&nbsp;February&nbsp;2020 No.&nbsp;66.Last modified 21 Feb 2022
