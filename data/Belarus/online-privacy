Belarus law does not specifically regulate online privacy. General requirements on personal data protection apply.
Certain specific online privacy requirements can be established under the legislation. For example, personal data of a person, who is a domain name administrator, can be disclosed in online WHOIS service of Belarusian domain zone only with consent of such person. However, consent is not required if the domain name was registered in the name of an individual entrepreneur.Last modified 21 Feb 2022
