The data files destined to the sending of advertising, promotions, offers and direct sale of products, goods and services or other analogous activities can only incorporate personal data with the consent of the owner, or when the data appears in publicly accessible sources.&nbsp;
The sending of advertising and promotions, through electronic means, must offer the possibility to the recipient of personal data to express their refusal to continue receiving advertising and promotional content of goods and services or, where appropriate, revoke their consent in a clear and free manner.&nbsp;
Companies or institutions that engage in electronic marketing, advertising and promotional content must be protected by means of a contract that establishes that the personal data contained in a data file has been obtained with the unequivocal and informed consent of the owners or that it has been obtained from publicly accessible sources.Last modified 20 Dec 2021
