The e-Procurement Instructions of 2018 mandates the use of JONEPS (Jordan Online E-Procurement System) in the implementation of public procurement.
The user of the system means the government entity, government unit, or interested party that submitted an application for registration on the electronic system and was approved by the electronic system manager.
The instructions explicitly state that the user of the system shall maintain the confidentiality of the information available in the system and take all necessary precautions and measures that would prevent the leakage of any information to any person, including the following:

Prevent the disclosure of information to persons who are not authorised to view or disclose it, and apply the highest levels of privacy, confidentiality, security and transparency of information.
Maintaining the security and integrity of data from alteration or modification by any party that does not have the authority to do so.&nbsp;

Additionally, the tenderer shall provide security controls to protect the system and devices, such as using anti-virus programs, using strong and modern programs and programs to detect intrusions from people or programs, and constantly updating information security programs.&nbsp;
Finally, the user of the system must use the system in a safe and sound manner, and it bears responsibility for any wrong use by it or by its users.Last modified 16 Feb 2022
