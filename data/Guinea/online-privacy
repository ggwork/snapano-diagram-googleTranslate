The Law on Cybersecurity and Personal Data Protection does not provide any specific rules governing online privacy.&nbsp;
However, the law prohibits and punishes with a prison sentence of one (1) to five (5) years and a fine of 30,000,000 to&nbsp;200,000,000 Guinean francs for carrying out or attempting to carry out direct prospecting by any means of communication using, in any form whatsoever, the personal data of a natural person who has not expressed his/her prior written consent.&nbsp;
In particular, it provides that any person has the right to object, on request and free of charge, to the processing of personal data concerning him or her and intended for prospecting purposes.Last modified 20 Dec 2021
