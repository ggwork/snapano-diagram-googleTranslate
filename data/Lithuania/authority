Enforcement of the GDPR is the prerogative of data protection regulators, known as supervisory authorities (for example, the Cnil in France or the ICO in the UK). The European Data Protection Board (the replacement for the so-called Article 29 Working Party) is comprised of delegates from the supervisory authorities, and monitors the application of the GDPR across the EU, issuing guidelines to encourage consistent interpretation of the Regulation.
The GDPR creates the concept of lead supervisory authority. Where there is cross-border processing of personal data (ie, processing taking place in establishments of a controller or processor in multiple Member States, or taking place in a single establishment of a controller or processor but affecting data subjects in multiple Member States), then the starting point for enforcement is that controllers and processors are regulated by and answer to the supervisory authority for their main or single establishment, the so-called lead supervisory authority (Article 56(1)).
However, the lead supervisory authority is required to cooperate with all other concerned authorities, and a supervisory authority in another Member State may enforce where infringements occur on its territory or substantially affect data subjects only in its territory (Article 56(2)).
The concept of lead supervisory authority is therefore of somewhat limited help to multinationals.There are two supervisory authorities in Lithuania: the State Data Protection Inspectorate and the Inspector of Journalist Ethics. The State Data Protection Inspectorate is responsible for monitoring the application of the GDPR and the Data Protection Law as well as ensuring these acts are applied, except where it is within the competence of the Journalist Ethics Officer. The Journalist Ethics Officer performs the same functions where the personal data is processed for journalistic purposes and for academic, artistic or literary expression, except for tasks and powers listed in Article 57(1) (j) to (l) and (n) to (t), Article 58(1) (b) to (c), Article 58(2) (e), (g), (h) and (j), and Article 58(3) (a), (c) and (e) to (j) of the GDPR.
In addition to the tasks established in the GDPR, the Data Protection Law authorizes the State Data Protection Inspectorate to perform the following tasks:

To provide advice to data subjects, data controllers and processors on the protection of personal data and privacy protection, and also to develop methodological recommendations for the protection of personal data and to publish them publicly on their website
To cooperate with personal data protection supervisory authorities of other countries, European Union institutions and international organizations and to take part in their activities
To participate in the formation of state policy in the field of personal data protection and to implement it
To implement the provisions of the Convention for the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data (ETS No. 108) and its Protocols
To perform other functions specified in the Data Protection Law and other legal acts

In addition to the powers established in the GDPR, the Data Protection Law authorizes the State Data Protection Inspectorate to:â€ƒ

Receive all necessary information, copies of documents and duplicates, and copies of the data from the data controllers and data processors, state and municipal institutions and bodies, other legal and natural persons; as well as access to all data and documents which are necessary for the execution of tasks and functions of the State Data Protection Inspectorate
