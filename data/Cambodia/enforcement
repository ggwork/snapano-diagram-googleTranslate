Since there are no regulatory or enforcement authorities that are specifically tasked with handling, overseeing or implementing personal data protection matters in Cambodia, the enforcement of the data protection would generally fall under the auspice of authorities across various sectors:

the Ministry of Commerce
the Ministry of Post and Telecommunications, and
the Ministry of Interior.
