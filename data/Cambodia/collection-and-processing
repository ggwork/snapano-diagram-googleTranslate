As Cambodia has not enacted any dedicated or comprehensive data protection laws, there are no laws or regulations in Cambodia that explicitly and specifically discuss the concept of collection and processing of data.
Based on Cambodia’s existing legal framework for data privacy, seven data protection obligations are either implied or explicitly imposed. Those obligations are discussed below.

Consent Obligation: Obtain consent from the individual before collecting, using, or disclosing his/her personal data for a purpose. Organizations should allow an individual who previously gave consent to withdraw his/her consent.
Purpose Limitation Obligation: Collect, use, or disclose personal data about an individual only for purposes that are reasonable and that have been disclosed/notified to the individual concerned.
Disclosure/Notification Obligation: Disclose to or notify the individual of the purpose(s) for which the organization intends to collect, use or disclose the individual’s personal data on or before such collection, use or disclosure of the personal data. The purposes notified must be reasonable.
Correction Obligation: Correct any incorrect or inaccurate personal data of a data subject that is in the possession or under the control of the organization upon request of the data subject.
Access Obligation: Allow data subjects to access their personal data in the possession or under the control of an organization for correcting the information under the Correction Obligation.
Protection Obligation: Protect personal data in its possession or under its control by taking necessary measures to prevent loss, unauthorized access, use, alteration, leak, disclosure, or otherwise.
Retention Obligation: Retain all personal data that is in its system, and that may give rise to civil and criminal liability.
