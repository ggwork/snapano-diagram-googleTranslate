Since Cambodia does not have any dedicated laws on data protection, there are no specific registration requirements for data protection. However, “Electronic Commerce Service Providers” and “Intermediaries” (in an e-commerce context), who would likely store, process and transfer the data of the data subjects, must register with the MOC and MPTC.
Under the E-Commerce Law, “Electronic Commerce Service Providers” are defined as persons who use electronic means to supply goods and/or services, except insurance institutions, and an “Intermediary” is broadly defined as a person who provides services of sending, receiving, transmitting or storing, either on a temporary or permanent basis, electronic communications, or other services relating to electronic communications, including persons who represent the originators; persons providing means of seeking any data in an electronic system; persons providing online marketing and online commercial services; and other persons as specified under the E-Commerce Law.Last modified 17 Dec 2021
