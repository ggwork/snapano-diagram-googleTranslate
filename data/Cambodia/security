Article 32 of the E-Commerce Law directly addresses matters of data protection in the course of electronic communication.
Service providers that electronically store consumersâ€™ private information must take all reasonable security measures to avoid loss, modification, leakage, and/or unauthorized disclosure of all consumer data. The E-Commerce Law notes, however, that disclosures are allowable with the consent of authorities, or with the consent of the individual whose data is being disclosed.&nbsp;The E-Commerce Law does not provide specific guidelines as to how or what mechanisms are required. It is simply required that any measures could be used as long as they could reasonably protect the data from loss, or unauthorized access, use, alteration, or disclosure without authorization or illegally.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The E-Commerce Law also prohibits any encryption of data that may be used as evidence for any accusation or offence. This obligation potentially allows governmental authorities to order the decryption of data implicated in an investigation.
The E-Commerce Law also makes a blanket prohibition on certain forms of cybercrime, including interference with any electronic system for the purpose of accessing, downloading, copying, extracting, leaking, deleting, or otherwise modifying any stored data in bad faith or without authorized permission.
In case the service provider is not under the scope of the E-Commerce Law, the obligations under the laws of general application that require consent of data subjects when collecting, using, disclosing, and processing data would imply that the service provider still needs to protect data from any unauthorized acts.Last modified 17 Dec 2021
