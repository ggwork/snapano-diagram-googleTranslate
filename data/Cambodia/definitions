Definition of Personal Data
Cambodian law does not specifically define the term “personal data,” or discuss what specific information constitutes personal data.
The E-commerce Law defines the term “data” as “a group of numbers, characters, symbols, messages, images, sounds, videos, information or electronic programs that are prepared in a form suitable for use in a database or an electronic system”.
Due to the absence of a definition of “personal data”, it remains plausible that any data of a data subject may be viewed by the regulatory and enforcement authorities as personal data of that data subject. Therefore, conventional data, such as full names, national identification numbers, passport numbers, photographs, video, images, phone numbers, personal email addresses, biometric data, IP addresses, and other network identifiers, etc., may arguably constitute personal data.
Definition of Sensitive Personal Data
There is no express definition of what constitutes sensitive personal data. That said, based on laws applicable to persons and entities in other sectors (such as doctors and banks), the types of data below are generally considered to be of a more sensitive nature, and thus should be handled with more stringent data protection mechanisms:

medical data
financial data
personal data of children, and
personal identifiers (e.g., national identification cards and passport details).

As there is no clear limit as to the scope of what may be considered sensitive data, any data of a data subject should be prudently treated as sensitive data to the greatest extent possible.Last modified 17 Dec 2021
