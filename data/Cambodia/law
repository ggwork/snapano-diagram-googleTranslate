Cambodia has not yet enacted any comprehensive data protection legislation.
The most recent update to the country's data protection landscape has come in the form of the E-Commerce Law, which contains provisions for the protection of consumer data that has been gathered over the course of electronic communications. The E-Commerce Law is thereby restricted in scope to virtual and/or digital data protection.
Other matters pertaining to data protection typically fall under the right to privacy, which is protected in broad terms under the Constitution of the Kingdom of Cambodia 2010, the Civil Code of Cambodia 2007, and the Criminal Code of the Kingdom of Cambodia 2009.Last modified 17 Dec 2021
