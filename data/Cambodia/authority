Since Cambodia does not have any dedicated laws on data protection, there are no regulatory or enforcement authorities that are specifically tasked with handling, overseeing or implementing personal data protection matters in Cambodia.
That said, the following governmental bodies may have substantial powers over data protection matters:

the Ministry of Commerce (“MOC”)
the Ministry of Post and Telecommunications (“MPTC”), and
the Ministry of Interior (“MOI”).
