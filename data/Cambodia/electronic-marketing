Since Cambodia does not have any dedicated laws on data protection, there are no special requirements when obtaining consent for marketing purposes. The E-commerce Law suggests that it is not necessary to obtain consent from the individual to send marketing communications as long as each marketing communication has clear and straightforward opt-out instructions and the individual has not previously exercised his/her opt-out right.&nbsp;Electronic marketing in Cambodia is subject to the general laws relating to digital marketing issues including:

Law on Consumer Protection, which prohibits "unfair practices" in relation to consumer transactions. Unfair practices include unfair sales; bait advertising;&nbsp;unfair solicitation sales;&nbsp;&nbsp;demanding or accepting payments without intention to supply goods or services per the purchase order;&nbsp;&nbsp;making a false claim or representation of some business activity;&nbsp;coercion by force and mental threats;&nbsp;&nbsp;pyramid schemes;&nbsp;&nbsp;selling goods bearing a false trade description; and&nbsp;any other unfair practices.
Law Concerning Marks, Tradenames and Acts of Unfair Competition, is relevant to comparative advertising. The following acts are considered acts of unfair competition: all acts that create confusion with the establishment, the goods, or the industrial, commercial or service activities of a competitor;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;false allegations in the course of trade of such a nature as to discredit the establishment, the goods, or the industrial, commercial or service activities of a competitor; and&nbsp;indications or allegations of the&nbsp; use&nbsp; of&nbsp; marks which,&nbsp; in&nbsp; the course of trade, misleads the public as to the nature, manufacturing process, characteristics, suitability for their purpose, or quantity of the goods.
Telecommunications Law, prohibiting all&nbsp; activities&nbsp; against&nbsp; the&nbsp; principles of fair, free, equal, and effective competition.
