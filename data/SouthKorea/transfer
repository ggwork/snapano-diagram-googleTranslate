As a general rule, a personal data controller may not provide personal information to a third party without obtaining the prior opt in consent of the data subject.
Exceptions to the general rule above apply in the following cases:

where there exist special provisions in any Act or it is necessary to fulfil an obligation imposed by or under any Act and subordinate statute
where it is necessary for a public institution to perform its affairs provided for in any Act and subordinate statute, etc, and
where it is deemed obviously necessary for the physical safety and property interests of a data subject or a third person when the data subject or his/her legal representative cannot give prior consent because he/she is unable to express his/her intention or by reason of his/her unidentified address, etc.

Under the PIPA, a personal data controller must obtain consent after it notifies the data subject of:

the person (entity) to whom the personal information is furnished
purpose of use of the personal information &nbsp;by the person (entity)
types of personal information furnished
period of time during which the person (entity) will possess and use the personal information, and
the fact that the data subject has the right to refuse to consent and the consequences of refusing.

While there is no additional requirement for the personal data controller other than the general requirements for third party transfer described above, there is a special provision for cross-border transfer of personal information of “Users” (which is defined as all individuals who use the telecommunications services provided by Online Service Providers). If a User’s personal information is transferred to an overseas entity, Online Service Providers must disclose and obtain the User’s consent with respect to the following:

the specific information to be transferred overseas
the destination country
the date, time, and method of transmission
the name of the third party and the contact information of the person in charge of the personal information within the third party, and
the third party’s purpose of use of the personal information and the period of retention and usage.

In principle, this requirement applies irrespective of whether the transfer constitutes a provision of personal information to a third party or an outsourcing of personal information processing, provided that the obligation to obtain Users’ consent may be exempted for outsourcing of personal information processing or storage of personal information if the aforementioned items are disclosed in the privacy policy.&nbsp;
Under the PIPA, when processing personal information acquired indirectly by way of a third party transfer, transferees who meet a certain threshold as provided by the Presidential Decree will be obligated to notify the data subject of (i) the third party source (transferor) from which the personal information was acquired, (ii) the intended use of the received personal information, and (iii) the fact that the data subject has the right to request for suspension from processing personal information.Last modified 21 Dec 2021
