Under PIPA, every personal data controller (which means any person, any government entity, company, individual or other person that, directly or through a third party, controls and/or processes personal information in order to operate personal information files as part of its activities) must designate a chief privacy officer (“CPO”) who must be an employee or executive of the company.
The CPO’s obligations under the PIPA are as follows:

establishing and implementing plans for the protection of personal information
performing periodic investigations and improving the status and practices of the processing of personal information
handling complaints and dealing with damage pertaining to the processing of personal information
establishing internal control systems for preventing leakage, misuse and abuse of personal information
establishing and implementing training sessions for the protection of personal information
protecting, managing, and monitoring personal information files
establishing, amending, and implementing a personal information processing policy
managing materials concerning the protection of personal information, and
destroying personal information for which the purpose of processing has been achieved or for which the retention period has expired.

There are no nationality or residency requirements for the chief privacy officer. In the event that a CPO is not designated, the personal information processing entity may be subject to a maximum administrative fine of KRW 10 million under the PIPA.Last modified 21 Dec 2021
