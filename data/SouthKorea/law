The Korean legislative system for personal information protection is composed of the Personal Information Protection Act (“PIPA”), a general, comprehensive statute and the Credit Information Use and Protection Act which regulates personal credit information.
The Act on Promotion of Information and Communications Network Utilization and Information Protection, etc. (“Network Act”) once functioned as a special statute that regulated the processing of users’ personal information by online service providers. However, after the substantial amendments to the PIPA and the Network Act on January 9, 2020, all provisions related to the processing and protection of personal information applicable to online service providers under the Network Act have been either removed or consolidated into the amended PIPA. The amendments to the PIPA and the Network Act went into force on August 5, 2020, and now the processing of personal information while providing online services is subject to the PIPA under a separate section exclusively dedicated to regulating online service providers (“Special Section”) further explained below. Note that other parts of the PIPA will also apply to “Online Service Providers” (defined as ‘telecommunications service providers’ as prescribed in Article 2, Item 8 of the Telecommunications Business Act and other persons who provide information or act as an intermediary for the provision of information for the purpose of earning profit, by utilizing the services rendered by telecommunications service providers) if the Special Section is silent on a given issue.
Two amendments to the PIPA have been proposed for pending review by the National Assembly: one proposed by a lawmaker (“Lawmaker Proposal”) and the other by the PIPC (“PIPC Proposal”). Both amendments intend to increase monetary rather than criminal penalties. The Lawmaker Proposal seeks to (i) combine and unify the rules pertaining to the collection/use and third party provision of personal information and (ii) require controllers to notify data subjects if their sensitive data is disclosed while services are being provided. The PIPC Proposal seeks to (i) combine and unify the data protection framework between online and offline, and (ii) strengthen the data subject’s rights such as introducing the right of data portability.Last modified 21 Dec 2021
