Definition of personal data
Under PIPA, “personal information” means information relating to a living individual that constitutes any of the following:

Information that identifies a particular individual by his/her full name, resident registration number, image, etc.
Information which, even if by itself does not identify a particular individual, may be easily combined with other information to identify a particular individual (in this case, whether or not there is ease of combination shall be determined by reasonably considering the time, cost, technology, etc. used to identify the individual such as likelihood that the other information can be procured)
Information under items (a) or (b) above that is pseudonymised in accordance with the relevant provisions and thereby becomes incapable of identifying a particular individual without the use or combination of information for restoration to the original state (referred to as “pseudonymised information”).

Definition of sensitive personal data
Under the PIPA, “sensitive information” is defined as personal information concerning an individual’s ideology, faith, labor union membership, political views or membership in a political party, health or medical treatment information, sexual orientation, genetic information, criminal records and biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person and race/ethnic information. Sensitive information can be processed if (a) such processing is required or permitted by a statute, or (b) the consent of the data subject is separately obtained.Last modified 21 Dec 2021
