The competent authorities may request reports on the handling of personal information, and also may issue recommendations or orders if a personal data controller violates the PIPA. Non-compliance with a request or violation of an order can result in fines, imprisonment, or both.
For example, PIPC, the supervising authority, can issue a corrective order in response to any breach of an obligation not to provide personal information to a third party. Breach of a corrective order leads to an administrative fine of not more than KRW 30 million. Prior to issuing a corrective order, PIPC may take an incremental approach and instruct, advise and make recommendations to the personal data controller. On the other hand, where personal information has been transferred to a third party without the consent of the data subject and in the absence of exceptional circumstances, both the transferor and the transferee (if it received the personal information knowing that the data subject had not given consent) can be subject to criminal sanctions (imprisonment of up to 5 years or a criminal fine of up to KRW 50 million).
For Online Service Providers, there is a special provision under the Special Section which imposes an administrative surcharge of up to 3% of the relevant sales (or up to KRW 400 million if it is difficult to calculate the relevant sales) for violation of key obligations of Online Service Providers.
Punitive damages&nbsp;
In instances of data breaches caused by the personal data controller's intentional act or negligence, the personal data controller may be liable for three times the damages suffered.Last modified 21 Dec 2021
