Under the PIPA, there must be a specific legitimate basis for processing personal information, with the most representative basis being the data subject’s consent. As a result, in principle, the explicit consent of data subjects must be obtained before processing their personal information.&nbsp; However, the data subjects’ consent is not required in cases where the processing of personal information is prescribed by a statute or where it is necessary for an entity to process personal information in order to comply with its legal obligations.&nbsp;
Exceptions to the general rule above which are applicable to personal data controller are as follows:&nbsp;

where there exist special provisions in any Act or it is inevitable to fulfil an obligation imposed by or under any Act and subordinate statute
where it is inevitable for a public institution to perform its affairs provided for in any Act and subordinate statute where it is inevitably necessary for entering into and performing a contract with a data subject
where it is deemed obviously necessary for the physical safety and property interests of a data subject or a third person when the data subject or their legal representative cannot give prior consent because they are unable to express their intention or by reason of their unidentified address, and
where it is necessary for a personal data controller to realize their legitimate interests and this obviously takes precedence over the rights of a data subject. In such cases, this shall be limited to cases where such data is substantially relevant to a personal data controller’s legitimate interests and reasonable scope is not exceeded.&nbsp;

Exceptions to the general rule above which are applicable to Online Service Providers are as follows:&nbsp;

if the personal information is necessary in performing the contract for provision of online services, but it is obviously difficult to get consent in an ordinary way due to any economic or technical reason
if it is necessary in settling the payment for charges on the online services rendered, and
if a specific provision exists in the PIPA or any other Act.&nbsp;

While one consent form may be used, separate consents must be obtained respectively for each type of processing activity (e.g. collection and use, third party provision) and for different types of personal information (e.g. unique identification information and sensitive information).&nbsp;
Under the PIPA, data subjects must be informed of, and provide their consent to, the following matters before their personal information is collected and/or used:

the purpose of the collection and use
the items of personal information that will be collected
the duration of the possession and use of the personal information, and
the fact that the data subject has a right to refuse to give consent and the negative consequences or disadvantages that may result due to any such refusal.&nbsp;

The collection and use or provision of the resident registration number (which is a type of unique identification information) is prohibited even with the consent of the data subject unless collection and use or provision is explicitly required or permitted under a statute.&nbsp;
When a certain business transfer occurs, the personal data controller must provide its data subjects a chance to opt out by providing a notice, including items of:

the expected occurrence of personal information transfers
the contact information of the recipient of the personal information, including the name, address, telephone number and other contact details of the recipient, and
the means and process by which the data subjects may refuse to consent to the transfer of personal information.&nbsp;

If the data subject or online service user is under the age of 14, the consent of their legal guardian must be obtained.Last modified 21 Dec 2021
