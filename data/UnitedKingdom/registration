The UK operates a fee-paying scheme for controllers under the Data Protection (Charges and Information) Regulations 2018, known as the ‘Data Protection Fee’. All controllers have to pay the data protection fee to the ICO annually, unless they are exempt from doing so.&nbsp;
The UK Government has set the fee tiers based on its perception of the risks posed by controllers processing personal data. The amount payable depends upon staff numbers and annual turnover or whether the controller is a public authority, a charity or a small occupational pension scheme. Not every controller must pay a fee – there are exemptions. The maximum fee, for large organisations, is GBP 2,900.
The maximum penalty for a controller who breaks the law by not paying a fee (or not paying the correct fee) is a fine of GBP 4,350 (150% of the top tier fee).Last modified 27 Jan 2021
