The PEC Regulations (as amended) deal with the collection of location and traffic data by public electronic communications services providers ("CSPs") and use of cookies (and similar technologies).
Traffic Data
Traffic Data held by a CSP must be erased or anonymised when it is no longer necessary for the purpose of the transmission of a communication.
However, Traffic Data can be retained if:

it is being used to provide a value added service, and
consent has been given for the retention of the Traffic Data.

Traffic Data can also be processed by a CSP to the extent necessary for:

the management of billing or traffic
dealing with customer enquiries
the prevention of fraud, or
the provision of a value added service.

Cookie Compliance
The use and storage of cookies and similar technologies requires:

clear and comprehensive information, and
consent of the website user.

The ICO released comprehensive guidance on the use of cookies and similar technologies in 2019.&nbsp; In line with the standard for ‘GDPR like’ consent under the PEC Regulations, this guidance significantly raised the bar in terms of the ICO’s expectations for cookie consent collection.&nbsp; It is now clear that the ICO expects consent to be collected on a clear opt-in basis – implied consent (such as the continued browsing of a website after being shown a cookie banner) is no longer sufficient.&nbsp; Instead, cookie consent modules that given users granular choices about cookie selection (typically on a ‘by purpose’ basis) are becoming the norm in order to align with the guidance.&nbsp;
Consent is not required for cookies that are:

used for the sole purpose of carrying out the transmission of a communication over an electronic communications network, or
strictly necessary for the provision of a service requested by the user.

Enforcement of a breach of the PEC Regulations is dealt with by the ICO. The maximum fine for a breach of the PEC Regulations is GBP 500,000, which can be issued against a company or its directors.Last modified 27 Jan 2021
