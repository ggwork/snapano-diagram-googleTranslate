The Information Commissioner (whose functions are discharged through the Information Commissioner's Office ("ICO")) is the supervisory authority for the UK for the purposes of Article 51 of the UK GDPR. Following Brexit, the ICO no longer has influence or membership in the European Data Protection Board and can no longer be nominated as a lead supervisory authority under the EU GDPR regime. This is reflected in the UK GDPR which omits Chapter 7 (Cooperation and Consistency) of the EU GDPR, on the basis that the UK will not be part of the EUâ€™s cooperation and consistency mechanisms.
The ICO's contact details are:
