Transfers from the UK
Transfers of personal data by a controller or a processor to third countries outside of the United Kingdom are only permitted where the conditions laid down in the UK GDPR are met (Article 44).
The United Kingdom Government has the power to make an adequacy decision in respect of a third country under the UK GDPR&nbsp; (Article 45). This power is equivalent to the similar authorities granted to the EC has under the EU GDPR and involves the Secretary of State making a positive determination that the third country provides for adequate level of data protection, following which personal data may be freely transferred to that third country (Article 45(1)). Currently, the following countries or territories enjoy UK adequacy decisions (these have all essentially been ‘rolled over’, on a temporary basis, from the EU GDPR): Andorra, Argentina, Canada (with some exceptions), Switzerland, Faroe Islands, Guernsey, Israel, Isle of Man, Jersey, Eastern Republic of Uruguay and New Zealand. &nbsp;The UK is also treating all EU and EEA Member States as adequate jurisdictions, again on a temporary basis.&nbsp; The United Kingdom intends to reassess all these adequacy decisions before the end of 2024. It also has the power to make its own adequacy decisions, and likely time consider new candidates for UK adequacy.&nbsp;
Transfers to third countries are also permitted where appropriate safeguards have been provided by the controller or processor and on condition that enforceable data subject rights and effective legal remedies for the data subject are available (Article 46). The list of appropriate safeguards includes, amongst others, binding corporate rules and standard contractual clauses with additional safeguards to guarantee an essentially equivalent level of protection to data subject’s and their personal data1.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Schedule 21 to the DPA provides that the EU Commission approved standard contractual clauses may continue to be used for transfers under the UK GDPR, until such time as they replaced by clauses issued by the UK Government.&nbsp; Note that the standard contractual clauses carried into UK law are those which were in use as at the end of 2020. It is expected these will be updated during the course of 2021.&nbsp;
Article 49 of the UK GDPR also includes a list of context specific derogations, permitting transfers to third countries where:

explicit informed consent has been obtained;
the transfer is necessary for the performance of a contract or the implementation of pre-contractual measures;
the transfer is necessary for the conclusion or performance of a contract concluded in the interests of the data subject between the controller and another natural or legal person;
the transfer is necessary for important reasons of public interest;
the transfer is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims;
the transfer is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject where consent cannot be obtained; or
the transfer is made from a register which according to domestic law is intended to provide information to the public, subject to certain conditions.

There is also a very limited derogation to transfer where no other mechanism is available and the transfer is necessary for the purposes of compelling legitimate interests of the controller which are not overridden by the interests and rights of the data subject; notification to the supervisory authority and the data subject is required if relying on this derogation.
Transfers demanded by courts, tribunals or administrative authorities of countries outside the United Kingdom (Article 48) are only recognised or enforceable (within the United Kingdom) where they are based on an international agreement such as a mutual legal assistance treaty in force between the requesting third country and the United Kingdom; a transfer in response to such requests where there is no other legal basis for transfer will infringe the UK GDPR.
Transfers from the EU to the UK
The UK is now a third country for the purposes of Chapter V of the EU GDPR.&nbsp; The trade agreement entered into between the EU and the United Kingdom resolves this by making it lawful to transfer personal data from the EU to the United Kingdom for a period of up to six months from 1 January 2021. This ‘bridging’ period is designed to allow the EU time needed to adopt a formal adequacy decision which will allow the continuing flow of personal data to the United Kingdom at least for an interim period (this is subject to the United Kingdom holding back from adopting any of its own adequacy decisions, or approving any new SCCs, that go beyond those already approved by the EU, without prior EU approval). The EU-UK Joint Declaration, published alongside the trade agreement, includes a clear commitment from the EU to secure a favourable adequacy decision for the United Kingdom within the near term.Footnotes1.&nbsp;Following the decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union in the Data Protection Commissioner v.
