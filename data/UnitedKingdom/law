Following the UK’s exit from the European Union, the UK Government has transposed the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) into UK national law (thereby creating the “UK GDPR”). In so doing, the UK has made a number of technical changes to the GDPR in order account for its status as a national law of the United Kingdom (e.g. to change references to “Member State” to “the United Kingdom”). These changes were made under the Data Protection, Privacy and Electronic Communications (Amendments etc) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019.&nbsp;At this time, all material obligations on controller and processors essentially remain the same under the UK GDPR as under the ‘EU GDPR’.&nbsp;
The Data Protection Act 2018 (“DPA”) remains in place as a national data protection law, and supplements the UK GDPR regime.&nbsp; It deals with matters that were previously permitted derogations and exemptions from the EU GDPR (for example, substantial public interest bases for the processing of special category data, and context-specific exemptions from parts of the GDPR such as data subject rights).&nbsp;
In addition,

Part 3 of the DPA transposes the Law Enforcement Directive ((EU) 2016/680) into UK law, creating a data protection regime specifically for law enforcement personal data processing;
Part 4 of the DPA updates the data protection regime for national security processing; and
Parts 5 and 6 set out the scope of the Information Commissioner's mandate and her enforcement powers, and creates a number of criminal offences relating to personal data processing.

A Trade and Cooperation Agreement (“TCA”) was signed on 24 December 2020 between the European Union and the United Kingdom which sets out details of their future relationship, including with regards to personal data. Of particular relevance is the creation of a six-month bridging period (from 1 January 2021) to enable the continued flow of personal data from the EEA to the United Kingdom. Further details can be found in the Transfer section.&nbsp;
Territorial Scope
The application of the UK GDPR turns principally on whether an organization is established in the United Kingdom.&nbsp; As under the EU GDPR, an 'establishment' may take a wide variety of forms, and is not limited to a company registered in the United Kingdom.
The UK GDPR also has extra-territorial effect, following the same principles as set out in the EU GDPR. As a result, an organisation that it is not established within the United Kingdom will be subject to the UK GDPR if it processes personal data of data subjects who are in the United Kingdom &nbsp;where the processing activities are related "to the offering of goods or services" (Article 3(2)(a)) to such data subjects in the United Kingdom or "the monitoring of their behaviour" (Article 3(2)(b)) as far as their behaviour takes place within the United Kingdom.Last modified 27 Jan 2021
