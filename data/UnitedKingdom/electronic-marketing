The UK GDPR will apply to most electronic marketing activities, as these will involve some use of personal data (e.g. an email address which includes the recipient's name). The most plausible legal bases for electronic marketing will be consent, or the legitimate interests of the controller (which is expressly referenced as an appropriate basis by Recital 47). Where consent is relied upon, the strict standards for consent under the UK GDPR are to be noted, and marketing consent forms will invariably need to incorporate clearly worded opt-in mechanisms (such as the ticking of an unticked consent box, or the signing of a statement, and not merely the acceptance of terms and conditions, or consent implied from conduct, such as visiting a website).
Data subjects have an unconditional right to object to (and therefore prevent) any form of direct marketing (including electronic marketing) at any time (Article 21(3)).
Specific rules on electronic marketing (including circumstances in which consent must be obtained) are found in the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003 (as amended) (“PEC Regulations”). The PEC Regulations are derived from European Union Directive 2002/58/EC (ePrivacy Directive), which have been retained in UK law post-Brexit.&nbsp;
The PEC Regulations prohibit the use of automated calling systems without the consent of the recipient.&nbsp; The PEC Regulations also prohibit unsolicited electronic communications (ie by email or SMS text) for direct marketing purposes without prior consent from the consumer unless:

the consumer has provided their relevant contact details in the course of purchasing a product or service from the person proposing to undertake the marketing
the marketing relates to offering a similar product or service, and
the consumer was given a means to readily 'opt out' of use for direct marketing purposes both at the original point where their details were collected and in each subsequent marketing communication.

Each direct marketing communication must not disguise or conceal the identity of the sender and include the 'unsubscribe' feature referred to above.
The restrictions on marketing by email / SMS only applies in relation to individuals and not where marketing to corporate subscribers.
Enforcement of a breach of the PEC Regulations is dealt with by the ICO.&nbsp;&nbsp; The maximum fine for a breach of the PEC Regulations is GBP 500,000, which can be issued against a company or its directors.&nbsp; The ICO regularly issues fines for direct marketing violations, and it is not uncommon for these to be in the hundreds of thousands of pounds range.Last modified 27 Jan 2021
