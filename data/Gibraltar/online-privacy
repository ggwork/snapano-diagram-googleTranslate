The Communications (Personal Data and Privacy) Regulations 2006 (the Regulations) deal with the collection of location and traffic data by public electronic communications providers ('CPs') and the use of cookies (and similar technologies).
Traffic Data
Traffic Data held by a CP must be erased or anonymised when it is no longer necessary for the purpose of the transmission of a communication. However, Traffic Data can be retained if:

it is being used to provide a value added service, and
consent has been given for the retention of the Traffic Data.

Traffic Data can only be processed by a CP for:

the management of billing or traffic
dealing with customer enquiries
the prevention of fraud
the marketing of electronic communications services, or
the provision of a value added service.

Location Data
Location Data may only be processed for the provision of value added services with consent and where the identity of the user is anonymised. CPs are also required to take measures and put a policy in place to ensure the security of the personal data they process.
Cookie Compliance
The use and storage of cookies and similar technologies requires:

clear and comprehensive information, and
consent of the website user.

The GRAâ€™s position is positive action eg via the use of tick box will be required by the user for the installation of cookies and that pre enabled boxes do not amount to consent. Usual data protection principals of the GDPR also apply. &nbsp;
Note consent is not required for cookies that are used for the sole purpose of carrying out the transmission of a communication over an electronic communications network or where this is strictly necessary for the provision of a service requested by the user.
Enforcement of a breach of the Regulations is dealt with by the GRA and if found guilty a fine and or imprisonment may be imposed. However an individual may also bring an action for damages in the Supreme Court.Last modified 22 Jan 2021
