The DPA has supervisory authority over the protection of personal data, as a systemic and independent control over the legality of the undertaken actions during personal data processing. This supervision entails the inspection, assessment, giving direction and imposing measures to data controllers and processors, through supervisors with the DPA.
The supervision may be:

regular (announced supervision, conducted in line with the DPAâ€™s annual supervision program);
extraordinary (unannounced supervision, conducted upon a request, initiative, ex officio or in cases where the supervisors suspect that a breach of the DP Law has occurred); and
control (conducted within six months after the expiration of the deadline for rectifying violations).

The supervisors enforce DP Law violations by ordering data controllers or processors to remedy violations within a specified time period, or by requesting the initiation of a misdemeanor procedure before the Misdemeanor Commission, taking the seriousness of the offense into consideration. Legal entity fines range from up to 2% and up to 4% of the total annual turnover from the previous financial year, with smaller fines of several hundred euros for the responsible persons at the infringer and the data controllers and processors who are natural persons. Additionally, there is a fine in the range between EUR 1,000 to EUR 10,000 for data controllers which are legal entities who do not adhere to the video surveillance requirements. Entities may dispute DPA fines by initiating proceedings before the Administrative Court of the Republic of North Macedonia.
Individuals are also entitled to bring private claims against controllers and/or processors and request compensation of material or non-material damages suffered due to a breach of the DP Law. Individuals also have the right to lodge a complaint to the DPA and right to an effective judicial remedy against a decision (or lack of) of the DPA concerning them.
The Criminal Code of North Macedonia includes a criminal offense for misuse of personal data punishable by a monetary fine or imprisonment of up to one year, as determined by the court.Last modified 15 Jan 2022
