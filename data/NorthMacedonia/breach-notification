Under the DP Law, data controllers are obliged to immediately (and not longer than 72 hours after discovering the data breach) inform the DPA, unless it is likely that the data breach may not pose a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons. Data processors are obliged to notify the data controller immediately after discovering the breach.
The notification is submitted on a special form prescribed by the DPA. The information may be gradually submitted without undue delays, only if there was no possibility to submit all of the information at the same time.
If the data breach is deemed to pose a high risk to the rights and freedoms of the natural persons, the data controller must immediately notify the data subject that their personal data has been breached. However, the data controller may not notify the data subject if:

appropriate technical and organizational measures have been implemented which ensure that the personal data would be unrecognizable to unauthorized persons (e.g. encryption);
the data controller has implemented additional measures which ensure that there is no longer a high risk to the rights and freedoms of the data subjects; or
if such notification requires disproportionate effort, in which case a public notification or a similar measure is implemented.
