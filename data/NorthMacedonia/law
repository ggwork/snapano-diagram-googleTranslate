The Republic of North Macedonia regulates personal data protection issues with the Law on Personal Data Protection (Official Gazette of the Republic of North Macedonia, no. 42/20,&nbsp;“DP Law”), effective 24 February 2020. Data controllers and data processors had an 18-month period from the DP Law’s entry into force (i.e. until 24 August 2021) to harmonize their operations with the DP Law. This period has been informally prolonged for additional six months, during which time the data protection authority will assist companies in the implementation of the new rules through education and corrective measures, as opposed to directly issuing fines for non-compliance.
The DP Law is largely harmonized with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) of the European Union (EU).Last modified 15 Jan 2022
