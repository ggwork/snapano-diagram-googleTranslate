The DPA keeps records of all data controllers and data protection officers and publishes them on its website.
Under the Law on Protection of Personal Data dated 2005, data controllers/processors had an obligation to register their databases containing personal data in the Central Registry of Personal Databases (“Registry”) maintained by the DPA. With the adoption of the DP Law, this Registry changes in a way that it continues to exist, i.e. continues to be maintained by the DPA, but as a registry of databases involving a high risk (“High-Risk Records”), whereas controllers/processors should notify the DPA about their respective high risk databases. It is also envisaged that the provisions of the DP Law governing the High-Risk Records shall cease to apply upon accession of the Republic of North Macedonia to the EU.
The DPA requires entities to report subsequent changes to registration details within 30 days of a change.
As a novelty, the DP Law obliges data controllers/processors and their representatives to maintain records of processing activities with an explicitly prescribed content. However, this obligation is not an obligation generally applicable to all data controllers and data processors. It applies only if data controllers/processors have at least 50 employees or, regardless of their employees' number, if the processing is likely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects, the processing is not occasional, or the processing includes special categories of personal data or personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences.Last modified 15 Jan 2022
