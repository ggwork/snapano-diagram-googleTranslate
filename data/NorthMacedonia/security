The DP Law requires data controllers and data processors to implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect personal data from accidental or illegal destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of personal data or unauthorized access to transferred, stored or otherwise processed personal data. These risks are particularly taken into consideration in order to assess the appropriate level of safety.
The technical and organizational measures include, inter alia, as appropriate:

the pseudonymization and encryption of personal data;
the ability to ensure the ongoing confidentiality, integrity, availability and resilience of processing systems and services;
the ability to restore the availability and access to personal data in a timely manner in the event of a physical or technical incident;
a process for regularly testing, assessing and evaluating the effectiveness of technical and organizational measures for ensuring the security of the processing.

The data controller and the data processor must always implement the technical and organizational measures relevant to the period in which they are designed and implemented, in accordance with the state-of-the-art technology.
The data controller and the data processor are obliged to apply appropriate levels of technical and organizational measures proportional to the processing activities, while taking into consideration the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing, as well as the risks with different probability and seriousness for the rights and freedoms of natural persons.
The technical and organizational measures can be classified in two levels:

Standard; and
High.

The process for managing the system for personal data protection is described in the internally adopted Policy on the System for Personal Data Protection, which should be regularly updated and harmonized in line with any changes in the data controllerâ€™s working process.Last modified 15 Jan 2022
