The Decision on Protection of Consumers Using Telecommunications and Internet Services (2020) regulates unsolicited commercial communications (e.g., phone calls or messages) to consumers, with the following restrictions:&nbsp;

such calls and messages are prohibited from 8:00 to 17:00, Monday to Friday
no more than 10 unsolicited commercial communications are allowed per month, per individual
no more than two unsolicited commercial communications are allowed per day&nbsp;

The decision provides that any individual or legal entity intending to use unsolicited commercial communications for their goods or services must receive the consent of the telecommunications or internet service provider of the prospects they plan to call. The decision does not offer guidance on how the relevant service provider’s consent may be obtained. Rather, the decision requires the telecommunications and internet service providers to ensure that unsolicited communication commercials are made by authorized persons. In addition, the decision delegates these providers to monitor the distribution of unsolicited commercial messages, thereby ensuring that these limits are not breached.
Consumers who receive unsolicited commercial communications can file a complaint with the MPT and resolve subsequent
disputes with the relevant service provider. The decision also notes that consumers can voice complaints or seek guidance via one of the following official hotlines:&nbsp;

1510 – Ministry of Industry and Commerce
1516 – Prime Minister’s Office
156 – National Assembly&nbsp;

The Ministry of Industry and Commerce’s website&nbsp;is also expected to become an available channel for complaints in the future.Last modified 14 Dec 2021
