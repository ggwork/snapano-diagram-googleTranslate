Under the Law on Electronic Data Protection, there is no data protection officer so to speak. The law introduces the idea that a team or an employee is required to supervise the protection of sensitive data; no information is provided on the duties and rights of such team or employee, or their scope of work. Moreover, the team or employee in charge of the protection of sensitive data is not required to register with any authority.Last modified 14 Dec 2021
