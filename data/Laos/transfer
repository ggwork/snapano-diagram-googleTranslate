The Law on Electronic Data Protection provides that the transfer of data must abide by the following requirements:

the Information Owner has given its consent for the transfer of the electronic data, and the individual or legal entity
transferring the electronic data ensures that the receiving entity can protect the electronic data properly

documents concerning important information, such as financial, banking, investment, and accounting information, must be&nbsp;encrypted


information which is transferred or submitted must not be distorted


the transfer must be in line with the agreement between the sender and the recipient


submission or transfer of data must be stopped when the receiver of the data does not intend to receive the information&nbsp;anymore.


The law does not address whether the requirements above should be applied to all individuals or entities, or only to the Data Administrator.
In addition, the Law on Electronic Data Protection emphasizes that any individual, legal entity, or organization contemplating sending or transferring personal data or official data (pertaining to governmental bodies) out of Laos must obtain the consent of the Data Administrator, and ensure that such submission or transfer does not contravene the Lao laws without further details.Last modified 14 Dec 2021
