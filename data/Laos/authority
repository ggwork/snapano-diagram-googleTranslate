The Law on Electronic Data Protection (2017) delegates the Ministry of Post and Telecommunications (MPT) to handle matters related to the protection of electronic data. The MPT is the main administration in charge of issues pertaining to electronic data privacy across the country. The MPT is assisted by its departments located in each of the 17 provinces that compose Laos.
In its tasks to analyze and respond to digital issues and threats, the MPT is assisted by the Lao Computer Emergency Response Team (LaoCERT), which was established in 2012. LaoCERT is under the direct supervision of the MPT and is the agency on the front lines that receives reporting of security breaches from individuals or legal entities operating in Laos and/or complaints of offenses committed online.Last modified 14 Dec 2021
