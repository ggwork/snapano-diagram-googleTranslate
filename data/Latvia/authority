Enforcement of the GDPR is the prerogative of data protection regulators, known as supervisory authorities (for example, the Cnil in France or the ICO in the UK). The European Data Protection Board (the replacement for the so-called Article 29 Working Party) is comprised of delegates from the supervisory authorities, and monitors the application of the GDPR across the EU, issuing guidelines to encourage consistent interpretation of the Regulation.
The GDPR creates the concept of lead supervisory authority. Where there is cross-border processing of personal data (ie, processing taking place in establishments of a controller or processor in multiple Member States, or taking place in a single establishment of a controller or processor but affecting data subjects in multiple Member States), then the starting point for enforcement is that controllers and processors are regulated by and answer to the supervisory authority for their main or single establishment, the so-called lead supervisory authority (Article 56(1)).
However, the lead supervisory authority is required to cooperate with all other concerned authorities, and a supervisory authority in another Member State may enforce where infringements occur on its territory or substantially affect data subjects only in its territory (Article 56(2)).
The concept of lead supervisory authority is therefore of somewhat limited help to multinationals.According to The Personal Data Processing Law the Data State Inspectorate (DSI) has become an independent institution, however, still supervised by the government.
In addition to the tasks provided by the GDPR, The Personal Data Processing Law provides for the DSI to perform the following tasks:

Verifying the compliance of the processing of personal data with the requirements of regulatory enactments when the controller is prohibited by law from providing information to the data subject, after receiving a relevant application from the data subject
Investigating administrative offenses
Participating, in accordance with its competence, in the drafting of laws and policies, and giving an opinion on draft laws and policy planning documents prepared by other institutions
Providing opinions on the compliance of the personal data processing systems created by state and local government institutions with the requirements of regulatory enactments
Monitoring the circulation of information society services in relation to the personal data protection
monitoring the operation of credit information offices
