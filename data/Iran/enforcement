Iranian courts generally enforce violations through statutorily defined remedies of the applicable law or regulation.&nbsp;
For example, the Cyber Crime Act provides that anyone who, by use of computer or telecommunication means, publicizes or makes accessible another individuals film, pictures or sounds, or personal or family secrets without consent, and causes loss or damage to the individual or violates that personâ€™s dignity will be sentenced to imprisonment between 61 days and six months or fined Rls 1,000,000 to 10,000,000.Last modified 23 May 2019
