Personal data may be transferred or communicated to third parties when it is carried out for the fulfillment of purposes directly related to the legitimate functions of the controller and the recipient, when the transfer is configured within one of the grounds of legitimacy and also has the consent of the owner.&nbsp;
It shall be understood that the consent is informed when for the transfer or communication of personal data the data controller has provided sufficient information to the data subject to enable him/her to know the purpose for which his/her data will be used and the type of activity of the third party to whom it is intended to transfer or communicate such data.&nbsp;
It will not be considered a transfer or communication in the event that the processor or a third-party accesses personal data for the provision of a service to the controller of personal data. The third party who has legitimately accessed personal data in these considerations shall be considered the processor.&nbsp;
The treatment of personal data carried out by the processor or by a third party must be regulated by a contract, in which it is clearly and precisely established that the personal data processor or the third party will only process the information in accordance with the instructions of the owner and will not use it for purposes other than those indicated in the contract, nor transfer or communicate it even for storage to other persons.&nbsp;
Once the contractual performance has been fulfilled, the personal data shall be destroyed or returned to the data controller under the supervision of the Personal Data Protection Authority.&nbsp;
The processor or third party shall be liable for any infringements arising from non-compliance with the conditions of personal data processing set forth in this Law.Last modified 15 Dec 2021
