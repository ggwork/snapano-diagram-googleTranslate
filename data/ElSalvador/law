El Salvador’s Congress approved a Personal Data Protection Act on Apr. 22, 2021. As part of the process of creation of a Law in El Salvador, all Acts approved by Congress are later referred to the President of the Republic for his review/veto/approval. In this case, the Act was vetoed and sent back to Congress for review but no further action has been taken in order to review the causes for the veto and/or make any amendments for its further approval.&nbsp;
Hence, data protection regulation in El Salvador remains disseminated in many other Acts that briefly regulate the confidentiality of a person’s information but no specific regulation is in place.Last modified 16 Feb 2022
