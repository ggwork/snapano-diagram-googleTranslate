Currently, there are no restrictions on the geographic transfer of data. However, if the Information Technology Bill, 2019 (2075) (which is currently tabled in the parliament of Nepal), if implemented in its current form, then the prescribed data held by governmental, public, financial, and health-related authorities would be prohibited for export outside Nepal. Also, Bill to amend Record Protection Act 1989 (2046) would further prohibit to export records of national importance outside Nepal.Last modified 22 Dec 2021
