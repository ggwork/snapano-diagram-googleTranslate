Data owners and processors processing personal data that is of particular risk to the rights and freedoms of personal data subjects, must establish a special department or appoint a responsible person (data protection officer) to be responsible for the personal data processing matters. Other owners and processors may either establish a department or appoint a responsible person on a voluntary basis.
There are no requirements for the data protection officer to be a citizen or a resident in Ukraine. However, if he or she is a foreign citizen under the general rule, a work permit must be obtained for him or her to hold such a position. There are no particular penalties for the incorrect appointment of Data Protection Officer.Last modified 21 Feb 2022
