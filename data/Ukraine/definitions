Definition of personal data
Data Protection Law defines ‘personal data’ as data or an aggregation of data on an individual who is identified or can be precisely identified.
Definition of sensitive personal data
There is no definition of ‘sensitive personal data’.
However, there is general prohibition to process personal data with regard to racial or ethnic origin, political, religious ideological convictions, participation in political parties and trade unions, accusation in criminal offenses or conviction to criminal punishment, as well as data relating to the health or sex life of an individual.
Processing of such data is allowed if unambiguous consent has been given by the personal data subject or based on exemptions envisaged by Data Protection Law (eg, the processing is performed for the reasons of protection of vital interest of individuals, healthcare purposes, in course of criminal proceedings, anti-terrorism purposes, etc.).Last modified 21 Feb 2022
