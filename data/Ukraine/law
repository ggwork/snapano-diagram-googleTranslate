The Law of Ukraine No. 2297 VI 'On Personal Data Protection' as of June 1, 2010 (Data Protection Law) is the main legislative act regulating personal data protection in Ukraine. On December 20, 2012, the Data Protection Law was substantially amended by the Law of Ukraine, 'On introducing amendments to the Law of Ukraine’ ’On Personal Data Protection' dated November 20, 2012, No. 5491-VI.

In addition to the Data Protection Law, certain data protection issues are regulated by subordinate legislation specifically developed to implement the Data Protection Law, in particular:

The Convention for the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data, executed in Strasbourg on January 28, 1981 and the Additional Protocol to the Convention regarding supervisory authorities and trans-border data flows, executed in Strasbourg on November 8, 2001 were ratified by the Ukrainian Parliament on July 6, 2010 (Convention on Automatic Processing of Personal Data) and have become fully effective in Ukraine.
