Prior to a transfer of personal data out of Russia, the data controller must ensure that the recipient state provides adequate protection of personal data. The fact that the recipient state ratified the Convention is sufficient grounds to deem that the state provides adequate protection of personal data for the purposes of the DPA.
Where there is no adequate protection of personal data, a cross border transfer is permitted if one of the following conditions is met:

the data subject consents;
the transfer is provided for under an international treaty to which Russia is a signatory;
the transfer is necessary in accordance with federal laws for protection of the Constitution, state defence, security and transport system;
for the purposes of performance of a contract to which the data subject is party; or
the transfer protects the data subject’s vital interests where it is not possible to get the written consent of the data subject.

In addition to the above, the Roscomnadzor issued the Order No. 274 of 15 March 2013 'On endorsement of the List of the Foreign States Which are Not Parties to the EC Convention for the Protection of Individuals With Regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data'. The Order contains the list of countries which are officially recognized by Russian authorities as 'ensuring adequate protection'. Apart from the Member States of the Convention, there are 23 so 'white-listed' states as of today.Last modified 15 Jan 2021
