In Russia, the Agency is responsible for the enforcement of the DPA. The Agency is entitled to:

carry out checks;
consider complaints from data subjects;
require the submission of necessary information about personal data processing by the data controller;
require the undertaking of certain actions according to the law by the data processor, including discontinuance of the processing of personal data;
file court actions;
initiate criminal cases; and
impose administrative liability.

If the Agency becomes aware that a data controller is in violation of the law, he can serve an enforcement notice requiring the data controller to rectify the position.
A data controller can face civil, administrative or criminal liability if there is a violation of personal data law. Officers of the data controller responsible for the offence may also face disciplinary action.
Usually, in the case of violation of data protection law, the Agency will serve an enforcement notice requiring the position to be rectified and may also impose an administrative penalty and/or recommend imposing disciplinary action on the officers of the data controller who are responsible for the offence.
The maximum administrative penalty that can be imposed, as at the date of this review, is RUR (Russian Rubles) 75,000.Â Last modified 15 Jan 2021
