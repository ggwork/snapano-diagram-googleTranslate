Data controllers may collect and process personal data where any of the following conditions are met:

the data subject consents;
the processing is required by a federal law or under an international treaty;
the processing is required for administration of justice, execution of a court order or any other statements of public officers to be executed;
the processing is required for provision of state or municipal services;
the data controller needs to process the data to perform or conclude a contract to which the data subject is a party or beneficiary party or guarantor;
the processing is carried out for statistical or scientific purposes (except where processing is used also for advertising purposes) provided that it is impersonalised;
the processing protects the data controller’s vital interests and it is impossible to have the data subject’s consent;
the processing is required for execution of statutory controller’s or third parties’ rights or for purposes important for the community provided the data subject’s rights are not in breach;
personal data that is processed was publicly made accessible by the data subject or upon his or her request;
the processing is carried out by a journalist or mass media as a part of its professional activities or for the purposes of scientific, literary or other creative activities, except if the processing would damage the data subject’s rights and freedoms; or
personal data that is processed is subject to publication or mandatory disclosure under law.

As a general rule, consents by a data subject may be given in any form, but it is the data controller’s obligation to provide proof that he has the data subject’s consent. Because of this burden of proof, it is important to keep careful records of consents.
In the following cases, the DPA requires that the data subject’s consent should be in writing (preferably in hard copy form):

where the personal data is collected to be included within publicly accessible sources;
where sensitive or biometrical data is processed;
in the case of the cross border transfer of personal data, where the recipient state does not provide adequate protection of personal data; or
where a legally binding decision is made solely on the grounds of the automated processing of personal data.

Consent is deemed to have been given in writing where it is signed by hand or given in an electronic form and signed by an electronic signature.
Consent may be revoked.
Consent in writing must contain the following information:

the identity of the data subject, his/her address and passport details and identity of the subject;
data representative (if any);
the identity and address of the data controller or the entity that processes personal data on behalf of the data controller (if any);
the purpose of the processing;
the list of personal data that may be collected and processed;
the types of processing that are authorised;
the term for which the consent, remains valid and way of revocation; and
the data subject’s signature.

The data controller shall ensure the confidentiality of personal data. The data controller and other persons who have access to the personal data, shall not disclose any information to a third party without the prior consent of the data subject.Last modified 15 Jan 2021
