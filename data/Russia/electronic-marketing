Electronic marketing activities are subject to limitations set by the Russian Law on Advertising No. 38-FZ dated 13 March 2006, under which the distribution of advertising through telecommunications networks, in particular, through the use of telephone, facsimile and mobile telephone communications, is allowed only subject to preliminary consent of a subscriber or addressee to receive advertising.
Advertising is presumed to be distributed without preliminary consent of the subscriber or addressee unless the advertising distributor can prove that such consent was obtained. The advertising distributor is obliged immediately to stop distribution of advertising to the address of the person who made such a demand.Last modified 15 Jan 2021
