If the data controller is a legal entity, it is required to appoint a data protection officer. Such an appointment is considered to be a personal data protection measure. The data protection officer oversees compliance by the data controller and its employees regarding the data protection issues, informs them of statutory requirements and organises the receiving and processing of communications from data subjects.
There are no legal restrictions as to whether the data protection officer should be a citizen or resident of the Russian Federation, however, it is adviseable that the data protection officer is available in case there is an inspection or other communication from the authorities.
Non-appointment or improper appointment of the data protection officer is a violation of the data protection regime and may result in the imposition of penalties and enforcement protocols, as described below.Last modified 15 Jan 2021
