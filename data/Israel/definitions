The draft bill proposes to revise defined terms under the PPL to align with the definition in the GDPR, such as definition of: personal data, processing, owner of a database, holder of a database and other. In addition, the draft bill attempts to limit database registration requirements to apply to certain categories of databases containing information of 100,000 data subject or more. The draft bill has yet to be placed on the table of the Israel Knesset for its first reading.
