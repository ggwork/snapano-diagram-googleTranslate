Subject to certain exceptions, database registration is required to the extent one of the following conditions are met1:

the database contains information in respect of more than 10,000 data subjects
the database contains sensitive information
the database includes information on persons, and the information was not provided by them, on their behalf or with their consent
the database belongs to a public entity, or
the database is used for direct‑marketing services.

A database is defined under the PPL as a collection of data, stored by magnetic or optic means and intended for computer processing, consequently excluding non‑computerized collections.
In 2005, the Ministry of Justice set up a committee generally known as the 'Schoffman Committee' which recommended relaxing registration of 'ordinary' databases and focusing on specific categories of information (e.g. medical data, criminal records or information about a person's political or religious beliefs).&nbsp; However, to date, the Schoffman Committee recommendations have not crystallized into binding legislation.
On November 11, 2018, the IPA published Opinion: Is the Collection of Names and Emails Considered a “Database”? in which the IPA ruled that a list of emails is deemed Personal Data.FootnotesFootnote 1: On July 23, 2020, the Israeli Ministry of Justice published a draft bill proposing to amend the PPL. The draft bill proposes to revise defined terms under the PPL to align with the definition in the GDPR, such as definition of: personal data, processing, owner of a database, holder of a database and other. In addition, the draft bill attempts to limit database registration requirements to apply to certain categories of databases containing information of 100,000 data subject or more. The draft bill has yet to be placed on the table of the Israel Knesset for its first reading.
