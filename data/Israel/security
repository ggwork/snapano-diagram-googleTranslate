On March 21, 2017, the Constitution, Law, and Justice Committee of the Knesset approved the Data Security Regs, which have come into effect on May 2018. The Data Security Regs further broaden the PPL by imposing additional requirements applicable to database owners, holders and managers. Such additional requirements include, without limitation, having in place a broad list of manuals and policies; various physical, environmental and logical security measures; and regular audit, inspection and training obligations.
Furthermore, the Data Security Regs add to the Outsourcing Guidelines, which in effect would expand the requirements applicable when outsourcing processing services, even prior to entering into a data transfer agreement between the database owner and the data recipient and the requirements to be included therein.
Failure to comply with the Data Security Regs will constitute a breach of the PPL, which may expose a non­compliant entity to criminal and civil liability, as well as to administrative fines.
In March and April of 2018, the IPA published guidelines regarding the applicability of the Data Security Regs to four types of organizations: organizations certified to ISO/IEC 27001 standard, supervised entities subject to the directives of the Supervisor of the Bank, management companies and insurers which are subject to the provisions of the Capital Market, Insurance and Savings Authority and non-bank stock exchange members subject to stock exchange regulations. These types of organizations only need to comply with selective provisions of the Data Security Regs.
On May 1, 2018, the IPA published the Privacy Protection Authority’s Policy for Reporting Severe Security Incidents. The directive sets forth the instructions on how to report a severe security incident. Failure to comply with the directive may lead to sanctions such as advertising the violation or deletion of database registration.Last modified 23 Dec 2020
