The transfer of personal data abroad is subject to the Privacy Protection Regulations (Transfer of Data to Databases Abroad), 5761-2001, pursuant to which personal data may be transferred abroad only to the extent that:

the laws of the country to which the data is transferred ensure a level of protection, no lesser than the level of protection of data provided for by Israeli Law; or
one of the following conditions is met:

the data subject has consented to the transfer;
the consent of the data subject cannot be obtained and the transfer is vital to the protection of his or her health or physical wellbeing;
the data is transferred to a corporation under the control of the owner of the database from which the data is transferred, provided that such corporation has guaranteed the protection of privacy after the transfer;
the data is transferred to an entity bound by an agreement with the database owner, to comply with the conditions governing the use of the data as applicable under Israeli Laws, mutatis mutandis;
data was made available to the public or was opened for public inspection by legal authority;
transfer of data is vital to public safety or security;
the transfer of data is required by Israeli Law; or
data is transferred to a database in a country:

which is a party to the European Convention for the Protection of Individuals with Regard to Automatic Processing of Sensitive Data; or
which receives data from Member States of the European Community, under the same terms of acceptance1, or
in relation to which the Registrar of Databases announced, in an announcement published in the Official Gazette (Reshumot), that it has an authority for the protection of privacy, after reaching an arrangement for cooperation with that authority.





When transferring personal data abroad, the database owner is required to enter into a data transfer agreement with the data recipient, pursuant to which the recipient undertakes to apply adequate measures to ensure the privacy of the data subjects and guarantees that the data shall not be further transferred to any third party.
The foregoing data transfer agreement must also comply with additional restrictions, to the extent that the recipient provides outsourcing services, as set forth in the Outsourcing Guidelines.
On January 31, 2011, the European Commission, on the basis of Article&nbsp;25(6) of directive 95/46/EC, determined that the State of Israel ensures an adequate level of protection with regard to automated processing of personal data.
Additionally, the transfer of databases is subject to the IPA Draft Guidelines No. 3/2017, which under certain circumstances, such as database recipient having a conflict of interest, might require opt-in consents of data subjects as a condition to transferring databases.FootnotesFootnote 1: Following the decision of the ECJ in Case C362/14 Maximillian Schrems v Data Protection Commissioner, IPA issued a statement on October 15, 2015, according to which US safe harbour certified entities would not fall under the foregoing condition, without derogating from all other conditions.
