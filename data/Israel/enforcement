IPA has the authority and obligation to supervise compliance and enforce the provisions of the PPL and appoint inspectors to carry out those activities.
Breach of the PPL may result in both civil and criminal sanctions, including administrative fines, 1â€‘5 years of imprisonment, and the right to receive statutory damages under civil proceedings without the need to prove actual damages.
The current draft bill for the 13th Amendment of the PPL provides IPA with the ability to conduct criminal investigations and to impose monetary sanctions in the amount of up to NIS 3.2 million. The draft bill has passed its first reading, but has yet to pass the approval of the Knesset Constitution, Law and Justice Committee; thereafter it would need to also pass the second and third readings, in order to become a binding piece of legislation.Last modified 23 Dec 2020
