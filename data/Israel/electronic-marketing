Unsolicited marketing is regulated under the Communications Law (Telecommunications and Broadcasting), 1982 (the 'Anti Spam Act').&nbsp; The Anti Spam Act prohibits, subject to certain exceptions, advertising by means of automated dialing, fax or text messages without first obtaining the recipient's initial opt‑in prior consent; all such communications also must contain an opt‑out / unsubscribe option.
Furthermore, the PPL governs the possession and management of databases intended for direct mailing service and imposes restrictions in connection therewith, including a database registration requirement specifying the purpose of direct mailing and specific record‑keeping requirements. Moreover, the IPA Guidelines No. 2/2017 impose additional requirements intended for direct mailing services, which, inter alia, include specific notice obligations such as indication of database information, sources and an initial opt-in requirement.
Additionally, the said IPA Guidelines govern direct marketing services which, inter alia, require specific opt-in consents and notice requirements.Last modified 23 Dec 2020
