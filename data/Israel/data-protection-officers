Appointment of a Data Protection Officer is required by an entity meeting one of the following conditions:

a possessor of five databases that require registration
a public body as defined in Section&nbsp;23 to the PPL, or
a bank, an insurance company or a company engaging in rating or evaluating credit.

Failure to nominate a Data Protection Officer when required to do so may result in criminal sanctions, including administrative fines.&nbsp; The PPL does not require that the Data Protection Officer should be an Israeli citizen or resident.
In the event that a data protection officer was appointed pursuant to the PPL, the Israel Protection of Privacy Regulations (Data Security), 5777-2017 ('Data Security Regs') require that the officer be directly subordinate to the database manager, or to the manager of the entity that owns or holds the database. In addition, the Data Security Regs prohibit the officer from being in a conflict of interest and require the officer to establish data security protocols and ongoing plans to review compliance with the Data Security Regs. The officer must present findings from such review to the database manager and its supervisor.Last modified 23 Dec 2020
