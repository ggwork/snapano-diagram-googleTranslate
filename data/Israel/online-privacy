The PPL does not specifically address online privacy, cookies and / or location data, all of which are governed by the general restrictions detailed above, including the requirements imposed on processing databases and direct marketing and the consent, purpose and proportionality restrictions.
The PPL governs information "about a person", as such depending upon the circumstances at hand, any non‑identifiable and anonymous information (which cannot be re‑identified) may reasonably be interpreted as falling outside the confines of the PPL limitations.Last modified 23 Dec 2020
