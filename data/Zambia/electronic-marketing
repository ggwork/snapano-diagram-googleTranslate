Electronic marketing is governed by the Electronic Communications and Transactions Act No. 4 of 2021 (the “ECTA’). The ECTA provides that a person marketing by means of electronic communication shall provide the addressee with:&nbsp;

the person’s identity and contact details including its registered office and place of business, email, contact and customer service number;
a valid and operational opt out facility from receiving similar communications in future;
the identifying particulars of the source from which the originator obtained the addressee’s personal information; and
applicable privacy and other user policies.&nbsp;

The ECTA also places restrictions in respect of unsolicited commercial communications to a consumer. The ECTA provides that a person may send one unsolicited commercial communication to a consumer, such commercial message can only be sent where the opt in requirement is met.&nbsp;
The ECTA further provides that an originator who sends unsolicited commercial communications to an addressee who has opted-out from receiving any further electronic communications from the originator through the originator’s opt out facility, commits an offence.Last modified 23 Dec 2021
