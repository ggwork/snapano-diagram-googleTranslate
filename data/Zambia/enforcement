The DPA sets out various penalties for offences prescribed thereunder. For example in respect of offences relating to the breach of the principles and rules relating to the processing of personal data, the penalty upon conviction is a fine not exceeding one hundred million penalty units[1] or two percent of annual turnover of the preceding financial year whichever is higher where the offence is committed by a corporate body.&nbsp;
Given that the DPA is a new piece of legislation, at the date of this update, we are not aware of any enforcement action taken by the Regulator.Footnotes[1] ZMW30,000,000 (at todayâ€™s exchange rate of US$1-ZMW16.37 approx. US$1,832,620.65)
