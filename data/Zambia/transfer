Transfer of personal data and sensitive personal data is subject to certain restrictions under the DPA. The DPA provides that personal data must be processed and stored on a server or data centre located in the Republic. The Minister may however prescribe categories of personal data that may be stored outside the Republic. The powers of the Minister notwithstanding, sensitive personal data must be processed and stored in a server or data centre located in the Republic.&nbsp;
Furthermore, the DPA provides that Personal data other than personal data categorised by the Minister may be transferred outside the Republic where:

the data subject has consented and

the transfer is made subject to standard contracts or intragroup schemes that have been approved by the Data Protection Commissioner; or
the Minister, has prescribed that transfers outside the Republic is permissible; or


the Data Protection Commissioner approves a particular transfer or set of transfers as permissible due to a situation of necessity.&nbsp;

Additional exceptions for the transfer of personal data outside the Republic are provided for, including:

in case of an emergency, to a particular person or entity engaged in the provision of health services or emergency services;
where the data subject has explicitly consented to that transfer of sensitive personal data; and
to a particular international organisation or country which complies with the DPA, where the Data Protection Commissioner is satisfied that the transfer or class of transfers is necessary for any class of data controllers or data subjects and does not hamper the effective enforcement of the DPA.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
