The ECTA provides that a service provider is not liable for any damage incurred by a person if the service provider refers or links users to a web page containing an infringing data message or infringing activity, by using information location tools, including a directory, index, reference, pointer, or hyperlink, and where the service provider:

does not have actual knowledge that the data message or an activity relating to the data message is infringing the rights of that person;
is not aware of facts or circumstances from which the infringing activity or the infringing nature of the data message is apparent;
does not receive a financial benefit directly attributable to the infringing activity; and
removes, or disables access to, the reference or link to the data message or activity within a reasonable time after being informed that the data message or the activity relating to that data message, infringes the rights of a person.
