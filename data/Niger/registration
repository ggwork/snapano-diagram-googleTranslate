The registration of processing activities via a "register of processing activities‚Äù does not exist in Niger.
The processing of personal data is subject to prior notification to the HAPDP. If a data controller appoints a data protection officer, notification is unnecessary unless personal data is being transferred across national borders. Additionally, Articles 40 and 41 of the Law provides that the data controller must create an annual report for the HAPDP regarding personal data which is stored within the period, as fixed by the HAPDP, in relation to the purposes for which each type of processing activity was carried out.Last modified 10 Jan 2022
