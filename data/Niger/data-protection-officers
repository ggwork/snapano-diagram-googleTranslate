There is no provision in the law relating to the appointment of a data protection officer.&nbsp;
However, Article 12 of the Law pertains to the designation of the personal data protection correspondent, which is defined in Article 1 as the person designated by the company carrying out the processing of personal data, to whom data subjects or interested persons may address any queries.&nbsp;
Article 12 of the Law continues to state that the correspondent must possess the required qualifications to carry out their duties and be able to make a list of processing activities immediately accessible for any person requesting the same. The correspondent is exempt from any sanction on the part of the employer resulting from the carrying out of their duties.&nbsp;
Furthermore, the data controller's designation of a correspondent must be notified to the HAPDP and, in the event of failures to carry out their duties, may be discharged by request, or after consultation, from the HAPDP.Last modified 10 Jan 2022
