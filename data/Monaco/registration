Data controllers, who process personal data must notify the CCIN and request approval so that their processing of personal data may be registered. Any changes to the processing of personal data will require the registration to be amended. Concerning data controllers who are legal persons governed by public law, public authorities and bodies governed by private law with a mission of general interest, the decision shall be taken by the competent authorities or bodies following a reasoned opinion from the CCIN. A recent Ministerial Order of 18 March 2021 has brought some changes to this procedure.
Any natural or legal entities governed by private law who intend to implement automated data processing including personal information must first complete the required procedure with the CCIN.
There are four possible procedures to follow:


Ordinary declaration (all nature or legal persons governed by private law usually fall under the ordinary declaration procedure);


Simplified declaration (all processing compliant to a referenced Ministerial Order and only when it is clearly established that the processing operations do not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of the data subjects);


Authorization request (only for automated processing of personal data relating to suspected unlawful activities, offences or security measures or including biometric data required to check personsâ€™ identities, or for the purpose of surveillance);


Legal advisory request (only processing relating to research in the field of health - excluding biomedical research and for processing implemented by natural or legal persons governed by public law, public authorities, organizations governed by private law entrusted with a mission of general interest or a concessionaire of public utility).


The data controller must decide which procedure is the most adapted to the processing he wants to implement. To do so, he needs to analyze the purpose of the processing, and depending on this purpose, complete one of the aforementioned procedures (ordinary request, simplified request, authorization request, or legal advisory request).
The notification to the CCIN should include at least the following information:

What data is being collected&nbsp;
Why the data will be processed&nbsp;
The categories of data subject&nbsp;
Whether the data will be transferred either within or outside the Monaco.
