Within the Principality of Monaco (Monaco) data protection is regulated by Data Protection Law n° 1.165 of December 23, 1993, modified from time to time and notably by Law n° 1.353 of December 4, 2008 and most recently by Law n°1.462 of June 28, 2018 (the “DPL”). Furthermore, article 22 of the Monegasque Constitution protects the right to privacy and the secrecy of correspondence of every citizen.
Further, Monaco is part of the Council of Europe and entered into Convention n° 108 of the European Council of January 28, 1981 for the protection of individuals in the context of automatic processing of personal data, and into its protocol addendum regarding the controlling authorities and cross-border flows of data, effective from April, 1st 2009.&nbsp;
Monaco is not part of the EU and did not adopt Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC (hereinafter referred to as the “European Directive”) or its successor the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation EU 2015/679) of April 27, 2016 (hereinafter referred to as “the GDRP”). &nbsp;&nbsp;
As a consequence, the European Commission does not consider Monaco as ensuring an adequate and sufficient level of protection in conformity to the Article 25 of the European Directive.&nbsp;
To address this issue, some of the European standards, and notably the European definition of “personal data”, have already been transposed into Monegasque law by legislations dealing with the automated processing of personal data, in particular:

Law n°1483 of December 17, 2019, regarding the creation of a digital identity (and thus, of a digital identification number) for citizens and residents of Monaco and, within this context, of a Monegasque National Register of Digital Identity, and
Law n°1482 of December 17, 2019, regarding the digital economy in general.&nbsp;

A new draft law incorporating some of the European standards is also expected shortly.&nbsp;
It is also important to note that, pursuant to article 3.2. of the GDPR, the GDPR is already applicable to companies established in Monaco that process personal data of persons (or “data subjects”) residing in the EU where such processing is related to (i) the supply of goods or services to such persons (irrespective of a payment for such supply) and (ii) the monitoring of their behavior taking place within the Union. It shall be noted that in such a case, the company established in Monaco may be required to designate in writing a representative in the European Union (article 27 of GDPR).Last modified 17 Jan 2022
