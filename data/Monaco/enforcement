The CCIN and Monegasque Courts are responsible for enforcing the DPL. If the CCIN becomes aware that a data controller is in breach of the DPL, it can serve an enforcement notice requiring the data controller to resolve the non-compliance. Failure to comply with an enforcement notice is a criminal offense and can be punished on conviction with imprisonment of one month to one year or a fine of between €9,000 and €90,000 or both.
Sanctions remain rare. The CCIN website only mentions one decision of sanction dated July 18, 2017, which was a warning and the fixation of an action plan to implement corrective measures, against a Monegasque company which didn’t submit to the CCIN a request to conduct automated processing of personal data. &nbsp;Last modified 17 Jan 2022
