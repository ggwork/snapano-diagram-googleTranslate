Data processing must be justified by at least one of the following bases:

The data subject’s consent&nbsp;
A legal duty imposed to the data controller&nbsp;
A public purpose&nbsp;
The performance of a contract entered into between the data controller and the data subject&nbsp;
The data controller’s legitimate interests, unless the data subject’s fundamental rights and liberties outweigh the controller’s legitimate interests

If sensitive personal data is processed, at least one of the above bases must be met plus one from an additional list of more stringent conditions (determined in Article 12 of DPL).
Additionally, the data controller must provide the data subject with fair processing information. This includes information about the identity of the data controller, the purposes of processing, the identity of recipients, the right to oppose, access and amend their data and any other information needed under the circumstances to ensure that the processing is fair.Last modified 17 Jan 2022
