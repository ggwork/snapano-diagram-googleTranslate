Prior to the use of traffic data, location data and cookies the CCIN must be notified. The use of traffic data, location data and cookies will have to comply with the provisions of the DPL.
In its Deliberation No. 2019-083 of May 15, 2019, the CCIN has specified the main principles applicable to the methods of depositing cookies and other tracers on the terminals of network users.
In this recommendation the CCIN insists on the requirement to insert a banner appearing as soon as an Internet user arrives on the visited site. It is also requested that no cookie other than those necessary for the operation be deposited in the user's terminal without its consent.
The banner must not be solely for information purposes but must allow the approval or deactivation of the deposit of cookies directly on the site by a positive action of the user.
According to the CCIN, the employer cannot access the contents of private messages sent or received from the professional e-mail system without the employee presence and agreement.
However, in order for messages to be considered private, it is necessary for employees to identify them as such for example by specifying in the message's subject key words such as "private", or "personal".Last modified 17 Jan 2022
