There is no requirement in Monaco for organizations to appoint a data protection officer.
However, appointing a data protection officer is viewed by the CCIN as evidence of a companyâ€™s measure taken in order to ensure compliance with the data protection legislation. In practice however, companies in Monaco do not generally appoint data protection officers.
