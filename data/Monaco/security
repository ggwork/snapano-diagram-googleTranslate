Data controllers must take appropriate technical and organizational measures designed to protect against unauthorized or unlawful processing, accidental loss or destruction of, or damage to, personal data.&nbsp;
Measures implemented must ensure an adequate level of security with regard to the risks posed by processing and by the nature of the data to be protected.
Where the data controller or their representative engages a service provider to process personal data, they must ensure that the service provider is able to comply with the obligations laid down in the two previous paragraphs.
The implementation of processing by such service provider must be governed by a written agreement between the subcontractor and the data controller that stipulates specifically that the service provider and his employees work under the sole directive of the data controller, and that he is also accountable for the obligations relating to the security of the processing.Last modified 17 Jan 2022
