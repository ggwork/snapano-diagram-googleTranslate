Monaco is not part of the EU, so the DPL does not distinguish between EEA jurisdictions and non-EEA jurisdictions.
However, the DPL provides that the transfer of data is authorized for cross-border access, storage and processing of data only to a country which offers equivalent data protection and reciprocity (and in particular circumstances, including for example when the data subjects gave his consent for such transfer or when the transfer of data is necessary to save his life or a public interest).
The CCIN has established a list of the countries deemed to offer equivalent protection and reciprocity.
Data transfers to countries with an adequate level of protection are not subject to the authorization by the CCIN.
The CCIN has adopted a position of principle and decided that all personal data transfers to a country or an organization which does not ensure an adequate level of protection should, in any event, be submitted to the Commission in the form of a transfer authorization application. Subsequently, the CCIN affirmed that it is necessary to submit a transfer authorization application to the Commission if personal data will be accessed from a country that does not have an adequate level of protection.
GDPR has an impact on data transfers to and from Monaco. Two situations must be distinguished:

Companies of the European Union that want to send data to Monaco:&nbsp;

They should no longer have to carry out any specific formalities with their supervisory authority as long as tools to protect the data are put in place between the European data controller and his subcontractor or subsidiary, notably:
o&nbsp;&nbsp; An approved code of conduct pursuant to Article 40 of the GDPR;
o&nbsp;&nbsp; An approved certification mechanism pursuant to Article 42 of the GDPR.
o&nbsp;&nbsp; Standard data protection clauses approved by the European Commission (art.46);
o&nbsp;&nbsp; Binding corporate rules (art.47);&nbsp;

Companies that want to send data from Monaco&nbsp;

As described above, they are still subject to the data transfer formalities of the CCIN if they wish to send data to a country which does not have an adequate level of protection.Last modified 17 Jan 2022
