According to Law 1266, there are two different authorities on data protection and data privacy matters. The first of them, which acts as a general authority, is the Superintendent of Industry and Commerce (SIC). The second authority is the Superintendence of Finance (SOF), which acts as a supervisor of financial institutions, credit bureaus and other entities that manage financial data or credit records and verifies the enforcement of Law 1266.
Nevertheless, under Law 1581, the SIC is the highest authority regarding personal data protection and data privacy. It is empowered to investigate and impose penalties on companies for the inappropriate collection, storage, usage, transfer and elimination of personal data.Last modified 24 Jan 2022
