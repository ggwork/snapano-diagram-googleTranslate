Since privacy and proper maintenance of personal data are fundamental constitutional rights in Colombia, every citizen is entitled to pursue protection before any Colombian judge, via constitutional action. Any judge may order a private or public entity to modify, rectify, secure or delete personal data if it is kept under conditions that violate constitutional rights. Constitutional actions can take up to&nbsp;ten days to be resolved and an order issued and failure to comply may result in imprisonment of the legal representative of the violating entity.
The Criminal Code of Colombia sets out in section 269F that anyone who, without authorization, seeking personal or third party gain, obtains, compiles, subtracts, offers, sells, interchanges, sends, purchases, intercepts, divulges, modifies or employs personal codes or data contained in databases or similar platforms, will be punishable by 48 to 96 months of prison, and a fine of approximately USD 26,700 to USD 267,000.
Finally, since SIC is an administrative and jurisdictional authority, it is allowed to investigate (as mentioned above), request information, initiate actions against private entities, and impose fines up to approximately USD 534,000, and order or obtain temporary or permanent foreclosure of the company, entity or business.Last modified 24 Jan 2022
