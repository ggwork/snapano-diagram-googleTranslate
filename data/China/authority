The PIPL has now clarified that the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) is primarily responsible for the overall planning and coordination of personal information protection and related supervision. Prior to the PIPL coming into force, various other legislative and administrative authorities have also claimed jurisdiction over data protection matters, and may continue to play some form of role in the context of personal information protection, such as:

National People's Congress Standing Committee
Ministry of Public Security
Ministry of Industry and Information Technology
State Administration for Market Regulation
Ministry of Science and Technology

It is also anticipated that the local Public Security Bureau branches and industry regulators will still have a role in both management and enforcement of data protection; and the TC260 technical committee will continue to have delegated responsibility to publish technical standards.&nbsp;
Notwithstanding the CACâ€™s newly-clarified role, sector-specific regulators, such as the People's Bank of China or the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission, may also monitor and enforce data protection issues of regulated institutions within their sector.Last modified 27 Jan 2022
