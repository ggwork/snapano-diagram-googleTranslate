Possible enforcement of, and sanctions for, a data protection breach in the PRC will depend on the specific data protection laws and regulations breached. Sanctions in relation to data protection breaches are scattered across various different laws and regulations, and the measures described below may not be comprehensive in all situations, as additional laws or regulations may be applicable depending on the industry or type of information at hand.
Taking the PIPL by way of example, it provides a range of sanctions, including (inter alia):&nbsp;

enforcement notices and warnings;
administrative fines&nbsp;of up to (for the most serious offences) 5% of the previous year’s annual revenue&nbsp;(unclear if local or global revenue)&nbsp;or up to RMB million,&nbsp;and&nbsp;confiscation of unlawful income.&nbsp;Note the PIPL imposes much higher fines than under other existing data privacy regulations);
cessation of processing;
suspension of apps and/or services;
suspension of business;
suspension of management/officials role;
criminal sanctions (for certain offences, and under relevant criminal laws);&nbsp;
civil claims;
social credit score or equivalent business credit files may be affected.

While the PIPL has now introduced higher fines, we anticipate that in practice the operational and contractual risks faced by organisations not complying with China’s data privacy framework – alongside increasing reputational risks&nbsp;– remain very significant and should be managed very carefully.Last modified 27 Jan 2022
