Under the PIPL, organisations which meet certain data processing volume thresholds (as yet unspecified by the CAC) are required to appoint a Data Protection Officer (DPO), and to register the name(s) and contact details of the responsible person with the relevant data protection authority.&nbsp;
For organisations based outside of the PRC, but processing PRC personal information, a specific representative or organisation within the PRC should be appointed, and details reported to the data protection authority.&nbsp;
Details of how and when the DPO or representative (as the case may be) should be registered is awaited.
Whilst the authorities have yet to announce the volume threshold for DPO requirements applicable under the PIPL, the PIS Specification requires an organization to appoint a data protection officer and a data protection department if the organization:

has more than 200 employees and its main business line involves data processing;
processes personal information of more than 1,000,000 individuals, or is estimated to process personal information of more than 1,000,000 individuals; or
processes sensitive personal information of more than 100,000 individuals.
