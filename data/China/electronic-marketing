Direct marketing by electronic means is only possible if the targeted consumers have explicitly consented to receiving such messages either at the time their electronic address / mobile phone number was collected or at a later time.
Specific information must be stated in each electronic message: for example, the identity of the entity sending the message, and a mark identifying "Guang ago" (which means advertisement in Chinese) or "AD" on a direct marketing message.
There are also specific rules applicable to direct marketing by text messages (SMS), and certain specific prescribed information must be provided to data subjects at the time their mobile phone number was collected or prior to sending direct marketing text messages.&nbsp;Last modified 27 Jan 2022
