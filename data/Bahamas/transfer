Section 17 DPA speaks to the international transfer of data. Under Section 17(1) the DPC may prohibit the transfer of personal data from The Bahamas to a place outside The Bahamas in cases where there is a failure to provide protection either by contract or otherwise equivalent to that provided under DPA, subject to certain exceptions. In arriving at a determination to prohibit the international transfer of data, the DPC must consider whether such a transfer would cause damage or distress to any person and consider the desirability of the transfer. Pursuant to Section 17(8) however, data constituting data required or authorized to be transferred under another enactment; or data that is required by any convention or other instrument imposing an international obligation on The Bahamas; or otherwise, data that a data subject has consented to having transferred, will not apply under Section 17.Last modified 22 Dec 2021
