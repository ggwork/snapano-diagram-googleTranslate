The DPC of The Bahamas is largely responsible for the enforcement of data protection in the jurisdiction. Section 15(1) states that the DPC may investigate or cause to be investigated whether any of the provisions of DPA have been contravened by a data controller or a data processor in relation to an individual when an individual has complained of a contravention of any DPA provisions or where he may otherwise be of the opinion that a contravention make have occurred. Enforcement measures the DPC can utilize include enforcement notices (Section 16 DPA), prohibition notices (Section 17 DPA), information notices (Section 18 DPA), and in rare instances bringing and prosecuting summary offences under DPA (Section 28 DPA).&nbsp;
Aside from its statutory functions, the DPC is also tasked with educating the public of data protection issues and trends and providing assistance in data breach remediation.&nbsp;
In accordance with Section 29(1) DPA, penalties for a person guilty of an offence under DPA are liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding $2,000.00 Bahamian Dollars; or on conviction on information, to a fine not exceeding $100,000.00 Bahamian Dollars. Further, Section 29(2) provides that where a person is convicted of a DPA offence, the court may also order that any data material which appears to the court to be connected with the commission of the offence to be forfeited or destroyed and any (relevant) data to be erased.Last modified 22 Dec 2021
