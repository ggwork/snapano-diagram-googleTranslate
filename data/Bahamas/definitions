Definition of Personal Data
Section 2 DPA defines ‘personal data’ as data relating to a living individual who can be identified either from the data or from the data in conjunction with other information in the possession of the data controller.
Definition of Sensitive Personal Data
‘Sensitive personal data’ is further defined in Section 2 DPA as personal data relating to: racial origin; political opinions or religious or other beliefs; physical or mental health (other than any such data reasonably kept by them in relation to the physical or mental health of their employees in the ordinary course of personnel administration and not used or disclosed for any other person); trade union involvement or activities; sexual life; or criminal convictions, the commission or alleged commission of any offence, or any proceedings for any offence committed, the disposal of such proceedings or the sentence of any court in such proceedings.&nbsp;
It should be noted that although sensitive personal data (‘SPD’) is distinguished from personal data under DPA in its specificity of certain categories of data, SPD does not otherwise receive any special treatment compared to general personal data. While DPA provides that the relevant Minister responsible for data protection may create regulations that would provide safeguards for such data under the Act, such a regulation has never materialized.Last modified 22 Dec 2021
