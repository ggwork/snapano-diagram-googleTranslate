Data subjects have the right to prohibit processing for the purposes of direct marketing by way of Section 11 DPA. Though DPA provides that ‘direct marketing’ includes direct mailing, it also applies by extension to electronic marketing and newsletters. In order to prohibit such processing a data subject may make a written request to the data controller to cease using any data that has been kept for the purpose of direct marketing. The data controller then has no more than forty days to either erase or cease using the said data and notify the data subject in writing accordingly.Last modified 22 Dec 2021
