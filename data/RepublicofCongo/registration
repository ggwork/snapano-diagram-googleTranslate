The Law requires, save for some exceptions, that the processing of personal data must be notified to the Commission. The Commission provides a confirmation of receipt of the notification after which the entity that made the notification can start processing personal data. If some of the data or sensitive personal data and the processing is not prohibited, a prior authorisation is to be obtained from the Commission. The Commission renders a decision within two months after receipt of the request to process certain sensitive personal data.Last modified 21 Feb 2022
