The processor of personal data must in case of a breach of the security inform the Commission without delay and at the latest within 72 hours after it identified the breach.
Mandatory breach notification
It is mandatory to notify every breach to the Commission, however, the 72 hours deadline does not apply in case there is no risk for the rights of the persons concerned. The breach must still be notified, but it must be explained why the breach was notified more than 72 hours after the identification of the breach.&nbsp;
The persons concerned must also informed of the breach if it poses an important risk for its rights.Last modified 21 Feb 2022
