A data controller who intends to process personal data is required to register with the Data Protection Commission. A data controller who is not incorporated in Ghana must register as an external company.
Upon registration, a data controller is issued a Certificate of Registration which is valid for two (2) years and must be renewed thereafter. The Data Protection Commission also maintains an online public search register of registered data controllers, which shows the status of the entity with the Commission as well as the expiry date of its current registration.Last modified 10 Jan 2022
