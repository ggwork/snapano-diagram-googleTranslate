A person shall collect data directly from the data subject unless:

the data is contained in a public record
the data subject has deliberately made the data public
the data subject has consented to the collection of the information from another source
the collection of the data from another source is unlikely to prejudice a legitimate interest of the data subject
the collection of the data from another source is necessary for a number of expressly designated purposes (for example the detection or punishment of an offence or breach of law)
compliance would prejudice a lawful purpose for the collection
compliance is not reasonably practicable.

A data controller must also ensure that the data subject is aware of:

the nature of the data being collected
the name and address of the person responsible for the collection
the purpose for which the data is required for collection
whether or not the supply of the data by the data subject is discretionary or mandatory
the consequences of failure to provide the data
the authorized requirement for the collection of the information or the requirement by law for its collection
the recipient of the data
the nature or category of the data
the existence of the right of access to and the right to request rectification of the data collected before the collection.

Where collection is carried out by a third party on behalf of the data controller, the third party must ensure that the data subject has the information listed above.Last modified 10 Jan 2022
