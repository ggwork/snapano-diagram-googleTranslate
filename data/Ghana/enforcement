Where the Commission is satisfied that a data controller has contravened or is contravening any of the data protection principles, the Commission shall serve the data controller with an enforcement notice to require the data controller to do any of the following:&nbsp;

to take or refrain from taking the steps specified within the time stated in the notice;
to refrain from processing any personal data or personal data of a description specified in the notice;
to refrain from processing personal data or personal data of a description specified in the notice for the purposes specified or in the manner specified after the time specified.

A person who fails to comply with an enforcement notice commits an offence and is liable on summary conviction to a fine of not more than one hundred and fifty penalty units or to a term of imprisonment of not more than one year or to both. A penalty unit is equivalent to GHS 12 (approximately USD 2.20).
Further, an individual who suffers damage or distress through the contravention of the data protection obligations by a data controller is entitled to compensation from the data controller for the damage or distress notice.
In October 2020, the Data Protection Commission announced its implementation of an Enhanced Registration and Compliance Software to streamline the registration and renewal process for Data Controllers. There was also announced an extension of the transitional period under the Act during which existing Data Controllers were required to register with the Commission by six months (from 1st of October 2020 to 31st March 2021). During this period, it is reported that defaulting Data Controllers will be required to pay only the current yearâ€™s registration fee, with all fees for previous years (up to 2012) in which they were to register but defaulted, waived. Pursuant to the Act however, such extensions of the transitional period are required to be made by a Legislative Instrument, however our checks show that no Legislative Instrument has been passed for this purpose.Last modified 10 Jan 2022
