One of the basic principles of dealing with personal data is that personal data must be collected for accurately pre-defined, stated and legal purposes and must not be further processed in any manner incompatible with those purposes.
Processing of personal data is permitted in the following cases:

The data subject has given its consent
If it is necessary for public authorities, local authorities within their competence established by laws of the Kyrgyz Republic
If it is necessary to achieve the legitimate interests of Holders (Owners)
When implementation of these interests does not preclude the exercise of rights and freedoms of data subjects with regard to the processing of personal data
When it is necessary to protect the interests of the data subject
If personal data are processed solely for the purposes of journalism or for the purpose of artistic or literary works
