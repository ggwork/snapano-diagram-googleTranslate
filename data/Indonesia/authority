There is no national data protection authority for data privacy in general in Indonesia.
For example, the FSA has the authority to act as the regulator of data privacy in the capital markets sector (since 31 December 2012) and with regard to banksâ€™ customer data privacy issues (since 31 December 2013).
However, please note that Article 73 of Reg. 71 provides that a business enactor who operates electronic transactions may be certified by a Competence Certification Body (Lembaga Sertifikasi Keandalan) which may be a domestic Indonesian (but currently no such domestic bodies exist) or foreign competence certification body.Last modified 17 Dec 2021
