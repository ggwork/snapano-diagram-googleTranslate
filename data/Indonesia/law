Specific regulations
In Indonesia, as of the date of this publication there is no general law on data protection. However, there are certain regulations concerning the use of electronic data. The primary sources of the management of electronic information and transactions are Law No. 11 of 2008 regarding Electronic Information and Transactions ("EIT Law”) as amended by Law No. 19 of 2016 regarding the Amendment of EIT Law ("EIT Law Amendment"), Government Regulation No. 71 of 2019 regarding Provisions of Electronic Systems and Transactions ("Reg. 71") and its implementing regulation, and Minister of Communication &amp; Informatics Regulation No. 20 of 2016 regarding the Protection of Personal Data in an Electronic System ("MOCI Reg. 20/2016").
However, for a number of years, a new draft Bill on the Protection of Private Personal Data ("Bill") is being discussed but to this date it has not been issued. Although the exact date remains uncertain and the Bill is still to be considered by the House of Representatives, if passed, this will become Indonesia’s first comprehensive law to specifically deal with the issue of data privacy.
In addition to the provisions under EIT Law, Reg. 71 and MOCI Reg. 20/2016, there are also a series of regulations which also cover certain provisions which may relate to data protection, such as:
