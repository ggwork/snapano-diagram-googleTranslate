The APPI requires that business operators prevent the leakage of Personal Information. The APPI does not set forth specific steps that must be taken. The PPC guidelines suggest recommended steps that business operators should take to ensure that Personal Information is secure. These necessary and appropriate measures generally include "Systematic Security Control Measures", "Human Security Control Measures", "Physical Security Measures" and "Technical Security Control Measures".
Guidelines often contain several specific steps or examples that entities subject to the guidelines must take with respect to each of the security control measures such as developing internal guidelines pertaining to security measures, executing non-disclosure contracts with employees who have access to Personal Information, protecting machines and devices and developing a framework to respond to instances of leakage.Last modified 1 Jan 2022
