Disclosing/Sharing Personal Information
Currently, Personal Data (meaning Personal Information stored in a database) may not be disclosed to a third party without the prior consent of the individual, unless the business operator handling the Personal Information adopts the opt-out method, provides an advance notice of joint use to data subjects, in the case of merger/business transfer or entrusting the handling of Personal Information to third party service providers.
Even disclosing the Personal Information within group companies is considered disclosing the Personal Information to a third party and consent must be obtained, unless it meets the requirements of joint use. The APPI also has permitted the "opt out" method, whereby a business operator can as a default disclose Personal Information to third parties, unless individuals opt out of allowing the business operator to do so. The Amended APPI stipulates that Personal Information that has been transferred from others through the opt out measure or that has obtained by illegal manners, and Sensitive Personal Information cannot be transferred through the opt out measure. The APPI requires a business operator to preemptively disclose to the PPC, and the public or to the data subject of certain items listed below concerning opt out.


the name, address and representative person of the business operator;


the fact that the purpose of use includes the provision of such information to third parties;


the nature of the Personal Information being provided to third parties;


the method by which Personal Information has been obtained;


the method by which Personal Information will be provided to third parties;


the matter that provision of such information to third parties will be stopped upon the request by the data subject;


the method for an individual to submit an opt out request to the business operator;


the method to update Personal Information which has been provided to their parties; and


the schedule date of provision of Personal Information.


The APPI does not provide any examples of how best to obtain consent from individuals before sharing Personal Information. Generally, written consent should be obtained whenever possible. When obtaining consents, it would be prudent to clearly disclose to the data subject the identity of the third party to whom the Personal Information will be disclosed, the contents of the Personal Information and how the third party will use the provided Personal Information.
The guidelines issued by the PPC provide the following examples as appropriate methods of obtaining the consent for disclosing Personal Information from the data subject:

receipt of confirmation of the oral or written consent (including a record created by electronically or magnetically methods or any other method not recognizable to human senses) from data subject
receipt of a consent email from data subjects
the data subject's check of the confirmation box concerning the consent
the data subject's click of a button on the website concerning the consent, and
the data subject's audio input, or touch of a touch panel concerning the consents

If Personal Information is to be used jointly, the business operator could, prior to the joint use, notify the data subjects of or publish the following:

the fact that the Personal Information will be used jointly
the item of the Personal Information to be disclosed
the scope of the joint users
the purpose for which the Personal Information will be used by them, and
the name, address and representative person of the business operator responsible for the management of the Personal Information.

Transfer of Personally Referable Information
The Amended APPI stipulates that prior consent from data subjects is necessary if Personally Referable Information is transferred to a third party and the receiving party can identify a specific individual by way of referencing such Personally Referable Information with any information that the receiving party already has in its possession. In general, such consents are to be obtained by the receiving party and therefore, the transferor needs to, in advance to transferring Personally Referable Information to a third party, confirm if the receiving party has already obtained consents. That being said, it is possible that the transferor collects data subjectsâ€™ consents on behalf of the receiving party.
Cross-border Transfer
Under the APPI, in addition to the general requirements for third party transfer, prior consent of data subjects specifying the receiving country is required for transfers to third parties in foreign countries unless the foreign country is white-listed under the enforcement rules of the APPI or the third party receiving Personal Information has established similarly adequate standards for privacy protection as specified in the enforcement rules of the APPI. Currently, UK and EU countries are specified as white-listed countries based on the adequacy decision on January 23, 2019.
According to the enforcement rules of the APPI, "similarly adequate standards" means that the practices of the business operator handling the Personal Information are at least equal with the requirements for protection of Personal Information under the APPI or that the business operator has obtained recognition based on international frameworks concerning the handling of Personal Information.
According to the guidelines for offshore transfer, one of the examples of an acceptable international framework is the APEC CBPR system. With regard to data subject's consents to transfer their Personal Information to foreign countries, the Amended APPI stipulates that the business operator shall provide the following information to the data subject when obtaining consents therefrom: (i) name of the country where the receiving party resides, (ii) data protection law system in the country and (iii) the data protection measures that the receiving party implements. In addition, the business operator needs to take necessary measures to ensure that the receiving party of such Personal Information continuously takes proper measures to process the Personal Information in a manners equivalent to the requirements of the APPI.Last modified 1 Jan 2022
