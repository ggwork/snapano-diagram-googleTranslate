Under the Amended APPI, business operators shall report data breach incidents to the PPC and affected data subjects if the data breach incidents could harm the rights and interests of individuals. The PPC set the concrete threshold for reporting obligations and in the case of any of the below (i)-(iv), the business operator needs to report it to the PPC and notify the affected individuals: (i) Sensitive Personal Information is or likely to have been leaked, (ii) Personal Information that would cause financial damage by unauthorized use is or likely to have been leaked, (iii) data leakage by wrongful purpose is or likely to have been occurred, and (iv) data leakage incident that involves more than 1,000 data subjects is or likely to have been occurred.
In addition, the PPC guidelines suggest that business operators (i) make necessary investigations and take any necessary preventive measures, and/or (ii) make public the nature of the breach and steps taken to rectify the problem, if appropriate and necessary.
According to the PPC guidelines, if a factual situation demonstrates that the Personal Information which has been disclosed was immediately collected before being seen by any third party or not actually disclosed, (such as the case where the company has encrypted the data or otherwise secured the data in such a way that it has become useless to third parties being in possession of such data), the notice to the PPC or any other relevant authority is not necessary.Last modified 1 Jan 2022
