Specifying the Purpose of Use
When handling Personal Information, a business operator must specify to the fullest extent possible the purpose of use of the Personal Information ("Purpose of Use"). Once a business operator has specified the Purpose of Use, it must not then make any changes to the said purpose which could reasonably be considered to be beyond the scope of what is duly related to the original Purpose of Use. In addition, when handling Personal Information, a business operator shall not handle the information beyond the scope that is necessary for the achievement of the Purpose of Use without a prior consent of the individual. In other words, the use of the information must be consistent with the stated Purpose of Use.
Public Announcement of the Purpose of Use
The Purpose of Use must be made known to the data subjects when Personal Information is collected or promptly thereafter and this can be made by a public announcement (such as posting the purpose on the business operator's website). When Personal Information is obtained by way of a written contract or other document (including a record made in an electronic or magnetic format, or any other method not recognizable to human senses), the business operator must expressly state the Purpose of Use prior to the collection.
A business operator must 'publicly announce or 'expressly show the Purpose of Use in a reasonable and appropriate way.
According to the guidelines issued by the PPC, the appropriate method for a website to publicly announce the Purpose of Use of information collected, is a one click access on the homepage so that the data subject can easily find the Purpose of Use before submitting the Personal Information.Last modified 1 Jan 2022
