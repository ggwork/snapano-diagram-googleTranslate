Each data controller (defined as a person or legal entity which processes personal data) must provide the DPA with specific information on the database containing personal data ("Database") established and maintained by the controller. The DPA maintains a publicly available register of data controllers and Databases.
The Database's registration includes two phases:

First, the controller must register as a data controller (this registration as a controller is to be performed only once).
Second, the controller must report to&nbsp;the Database's establishment, which has to be done within 14 days.

Registration of the Database is made by submitting the application in the prescribed form to the DPA. The DPA form includes information regarding:

Data controller&nbsp;



Name




Address of its registered seat



The Database itself



Processing purpose




Legal ground for its establishment




Identification of exact processing activities




Types of processed data




Categories of data subjects, and




Transfer of data abroad


If there is a subsequent change in the registered data, for example changing initial processing activities, the change needs to be reported to the DPA within 14 days from the date the change occurred.
Unlike the DP Law, the Draft Data Protection Law foresees the obligation of data controllers and data processors to keep records of their data processing activities identically as the GDPR, however it does not oblige data controllers to register their data processing activities/databases with the Agency.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last modified 12 Jan 2021
