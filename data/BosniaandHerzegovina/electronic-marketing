Although electronic marketing is not governed by the DP Law, the respective law regulates protection of personal data used in direct marketing. In that regard, the controller is not allowed to disclose personal data to a third party without the data subject’s consent. However, when that is necessary for the protection of the controller’s rights and interests and when it is not in contradiction with the data subject’s right to the protection of personal privacy and personal life, the personal data may be used for direct marketing purposes without consent. The DPA is of the opinion that previous provision could be used only in explicit cases, when the controller is offering products or services to regular client in order to limit possible future damages for which he could be held responsible.
Under Regulation B, the Operator is prohibited from using user personal data for purposes of its business or other promotions, unless it obtains explicit consent from the user to whom such data relates.Last modified 12 Jan 2021
