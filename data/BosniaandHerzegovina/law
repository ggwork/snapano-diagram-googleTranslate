The Law on Protection of Personal Data ('Official Gazette of BIH', nos. 49/06, 76/11 and 89/11) (DP Law) is the governing law regulating data protection issues in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH). The DP Law came into force on July 4, 2006 and was amended on October 3, 2011.
Due to the deficiencies and non-alignment of the DP Law with the GDPR, in 2018, the competent authorities initiated the procedure for adoption of a new GDPR compliant data protection law in BiH. According to the publicly available information the draft of the new data protection law (Draft Data Protection Law), was forwarded to the BiH Ministry of Civil Affairs and the adoption procedure before the BiH Parliament should have been initiated. However, due to the complex political situation as well as the Covid-19 pandemic, the Draft Data Protection Law is not adopted to date. However, we expect the Draft Data Protection Law to be adopted in its current text within 2021.Last modified 12 Jan 2021
