There is no statutory obligation that the entity which processes personal data has a data protection officer. The Rules on the Manner of Keeping and Special Measures of Personal Data Technical Protection (Official Gazette of BiH no. 67/09) (Rules) stipulate that a controller can have an administrator of the Database. Such administrator is a natural person authorized and responsible for managing the Database and ensuring privacy and protection of personal data processing, in particular regarding implementation of security measures, storage and protection of data.
Unlike DP Law, the Draft Data Protection foresees the obligation of data controller and processor to ensure properly and timely involvement of the data protection officer in all issues related to the protection of personal data. Position and tasks of data protection officer envisaged by Draft Data Protection Law correspond to those prescribed by GDPR.Last modified 12 Jan 2021
