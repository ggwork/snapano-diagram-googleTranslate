The DP Law requires data controllers and processors to:

Take care of data security and to undertake all technical and organizational measures


Undertake measures against unauthorized or accidental access to personal data, their alteration, destruction or loss, unauthorized transfer, other forms of illegal data processing, as well as measures against misuse of personal data


Adopt a personal data security plan ("Security Plan") which specifies technical and organizational measures for the security of personal data

As provided by the Rules (as defined in the section "Data Protection Officers"), the Security Plan includes the categories of processed data and the list of instruments for protection of the data to ensure confidentiality, integrity, availability, authenticity, possibility of revision and transparency of the personal data.
The Rules prescribe that the controller is required to undertake more stringent technical and organizational measures when processing sensitive personal data. Such measures aim at enabling recognition of each authorized access to the information system, operation with the data during the controllerâ€™s regular working hours and cryptographic protection of the data transmission via telecommunications systems with appropriate software and technical measures.
The Rules also closely regulate the manner of personal data keeping and personal data protection in automatic processing.
Security measures envisaged by Draft Data Protection Law correspond to the measures prescribed by GDPR.Last modified 12 Jan 2021
