Under the transfer rules set out in the DP Law, processed personal data may be transferred to countries where an adequate level of personal data protection is ensured. In that regard, preferential status is given to the member states of the Council of Europe Convention for the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data ("Convention"), as members of the Convention ensure an adequate level of personal data protection.
Personal data transfer to countries that do not provide for an adequate level of personal data protection is allowed in certain cases stipulated by the DP Law, for example:

When the data subject consented to the transfer and was made aware of possible consequences of such transfer


When it is required for the purpose of fulfilling the contract or legal claim


When it is required for the protection of public interest

In addition, the DPA may exceptionally approve the transfer to a country that does not ensure adequate an level of personal data protection if the controller in the country where the data is to be transferred can provide for sufficient guarantees in regard to the protection of privacy and fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject.
The Draft Data Protection Law prescribes a set of mechanisms based on which a legitimate transfer of data out of BiH is possible. This means that the Draft Data Protection Law tends, the same as the GDPR, to enable legitimate transfer of personal data whenever there are some safeguards that transferred data will be processed in line with the law.
Aforementioned means the following:

It should firstly be checked whether a particular country to which the data is to be transferred is regarded as a country with an adequate data protection system (“Adequate Country”)
If a country to which the data is to be transferred from BiH is the Adequate Country or if there is a data transfer related international treaty entered into between BiH and that country, a transfer is possible without any approval of the Agency (“Transfer Approval”)
On the other hand, if a country to which the data is to be transferred is not the Adequate Country, a transfer is still possible without the Transfer Approval if the adequate data protection measures are undertaken (e.g., if appropriate standard contractual clauses have been entered into between a data exporter and a data importer) (“Adequate Safeguards”)
However, even if there are no Adequate Safeguards, there is still a possibility for transferring the data without the Transfer Approval. Such possibility exists in so-called special situations, explicitly prescribed by the Draft Data Protection Law, the same as under the GDPR (e.g., a data subject has consented to a particular transfer, a transfer is necessary for the realization of an agreement between a data subject and data controller, etc.)
Finally, even if none of the aforementioned special situations is applicable, a data transfer is still allowed without the Transfer Approval if certain conditions (linked to a data controller's legitimate interest) explicitly prescribed by the Draft Data Protection Law are cumulatively fulfilled.
