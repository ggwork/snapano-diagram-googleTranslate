Definition of Personal Data
National Ordinance Person Registration&nbsp;
According to the Explanatory Memorandum on the National Ordinance Person Registration the term personal data has a broad meaning. This does not only concern data that can identify a person, but concerns any data that can be associated with a particular person; it is foreseeable that under certain circumstances data can be traced to one person through systematic comparison and lengthy investigations. Personal identifiable confidential data is therefore not only limited to home address, email address, telephone number, membership number and/or identity number.&nbsp;
