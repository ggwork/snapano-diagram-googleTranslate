National Ordinance Person Registration
Contains no specific clauses.&nbsp;
GDPR&nbsp;
Cookies, insofar as they are used to identify users, qualify as personal data and are therefore subject to the GDPR. Companies do have a right to process their users’ data as long as they receive consent or if they have a legitimate interest.&nbsp;
Location data, the GDPR will apply if the data collector collects the location data from the device and if it can be used to identify a person.&nbsp;
If the data is anonymized such that it cannot be linked to a person, then the GDPR will not apply. However, if the location data is processed with other data related to a user, the device or the user’s behavior, or is used in a manner to single out individuals from others, then it will be “personal data” and fall within the scope of the GDPR even if traditional identifiers such as name, address etc. are not known.Last modified 21 Dec 2021
