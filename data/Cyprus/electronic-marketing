The GDPR will apply to most electronic marketing activities, as these will involve some use of personal data (eg, an email address which includes the recipient's name). The most plausible legal bases for electronic marketing will be consent, or the legitimate interests of the controller (which is expressly referenced as an appropriate basis by Recital 47). Where consent is relied upon, the strict standards for consent under the GDPR are to be noted, and marketing consent forms will invariably need to incorporate clearly worded opt-in mechanisms (such as the ticking of an unticked consent box, or the signing of a statement, and not merely the acceptance of terms and conditions, or consent implied from conduct, such as visiting a website).
Data subjects have an unconditional right to object to (and therefore prevent) any form of direct marketing (including electronic marketing) at any time (Article 21(3)).
Specific rules on electronic marketing (including circumstances in which consent must be obtained) are to be found in Directive 2002/58/EC (ePrivacy Directive), as transposed into the local laws of each Member State. The ePrivacy Directive is to be replaced by a Regulation. However, it is currently uncertain when this is going to happen, as the European Commission has discarded its draft of the ePrivacy Regulation after disagreements by the Member States in the Council of the European Union. In the meantime, GDPR Article 94 makes it clear that references to the repealed Directive 95/46/EC will be replaced with references to the GDPR. As such, references to the Directive 95/46/EC standard for consent in the ePrivacy Directive will be replaced with the GDPR standard for consent.
The Regulation of Electronic Communications and Postal Services Law of 2004 (112(I)/2004) as amended (the "Electronic Communications&nbsp;and Postal Services Law") will apply to most electronic marketing activities, as there is likely to be processing and use of personal data involved (eg, an email address is likely to be personal data for the purposes of the Electronic Communication and Postal Services Law).
Section 106 of the Electronic Communications and Postal Services Law states the following:

The use of automatic calling machines, fax, or electronic mail, or SMS messages, for the purposes of direct marketing, may only be allowed in respect to subscribers or users who have given their prior consent&nbsp;
Unsolicited communications for the purposes of direct marketing, by means other than those referred to in (1) above, are not allowed without the consent of the subscribers or users concerned&nbsp;
The rights referred to in (1) and (2) above shall apply to subscribers who are natural persons. The Commissioner of Electronic Communications and Postal Regulation, may, after consultation with the Personal Data Commissioner, issue orders to safeguard that legitimate interests of legal persons, regarding unsolicited communications, are adequately protected. In 2005, the Commissioner of Electronic Communications and Postal Regulation issued the 2005 Order regarding Safeguarding the Interests of Legal Persons in relation to Unsolicited Communications, by virtue of which the protection from unsolicited communications for the purposes of direct marketing has been extended to legal persons as well&nbsp;
Notwithstanding (1) above, in cases where a natural or legal person obtains from its customers contact details for electronic mail, in the context of the sale of a product or a service, the same natural or legal person may use these electronic details for direct marketing of its own similar products or services, provided that customers are clearly and distinctly given the opportunity to object, free of charge and in an easy manner, to such use of their electronic contact details when they are collected and on the occasion of each message in case the customer has not initially refused such use, and&nbsp;
Electronic mail sent for direct marketing must not disguise or conceal the identity of the sender or the person on whose behalf and / or for the benefit of the communication is made, or without a valid address to which the recipient may send a request that such communication cease.
