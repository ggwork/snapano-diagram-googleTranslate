GOVERNING TEXTS</h2><p>While the digital transition of society is a great economic opportunity, digital spaces are also vulnerable spaces as cyber-attacks progress rapidly. Indeed, the increase in cyberattacks is no longer a secret to anyone. While the number of cyberattacks increases year after year, 2020 was simply explosive. In 2020, the <a href="https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/" target="_blank">National Cybersecurity Agency of France</a> ('ANSSI') reported that 192 ransomware attacks were handled, compared to 54 in 2019.</p><p>Also, it is no secret that many cyberattacks lead to data breaches (examples include personal data altered, no longer available, erased data, or data shared publicly). It turns out that according to the <a href="http://www.data.gouv.fr/" target="_blank">French Government website</a>, between January and November 2020, 2,570 data breaches were notified to the <a href="https://www.cnil.fr/" target="_blank">French data protection authority</a> ('CNIL').</p><p>Therefore, while cybersecurity regulation ensures that organisations provide for strong cybersecurity practices, data protection laws ensure that organisations also provide strong organisational and technical measures to ensure the security of personal data in a digital environment. According to data protection laws, organisations must notify data protection authorities and data subjects when a high-risk threat is caused to the rights and liberties of data subjects due to a data breach. Therefore, when cybersecurity is no longer ensured and personal data is seriously affected, data subjects must be warned that their data has been exposed.</p><p>In France, Act No. 2018-133 of 26 February 2018 laying down Various Provisions for Adaptation of European Union Law in the field of Security (only available in French <a href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do;jsessionid=65B8BE277709BD74DF2E90B841C184A2.tplgfr36s_3?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000036644772&amp;dateTexte=20200227" target="_blank">here</a>) ('the Cybersecurity Act') implements the <a href="https://platform.dataguidance.com/legal-research/directive-security-network-and-information-systems-directive-eu-20161148-nis" target="_blank">Directive on Security Network and Information Systems (Directive (EU) 2016/1148) </a>('the NIS Directive').</p><p>The following texts further implement the NIS Directive:</p><ul><li>Decree 2018-384 of 23 May 2018 on the Security of Network and Information Systems of Operators of Essential Services and Digital Service Providers (only available in French <a href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000036939971&amp;dateTexte=&amp;oldAction=rechJO&amp;categorieLien=id&amp;idJO=JORFCONT000036939966#JORFSCTA000036939983" target="_blank" class="toc-filter-processed">here</a>) ('the Decree'), which sets out the terms of application of the legislative obligations and lists the sectors, types of operators and essential services concerned;</li><li>Order of June 13, 2018 setting the terms of the declarations provided for in Articles 8, 11 and 20 of Decree No. 2018-384 of May 23, 2018 relating to the security of networks and information systems of operators of essential services and service providers digital (only available in French <a href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/loda/id/JORFTEXT000037102068/" target="_blank">here</a>) ('the Reporting Order'); and</li><li>Order of September 14, 2018 setting the security rules and deadlines mentioned in Article 10 of Decree No. 2018-384 of May 23, 2018 relating to the security of networks and information systems of operators of essential services and providers of digital service (only available in French <a href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/loda/id/JORFTEXT000037444012/" target="_blank">here</a>) ('the Security Rules Order').</li></ul><p>Following those implementations texts, two new legal categories were created: the operators of essential services ('OES') and digital services providers ('DSP').</p><div name="1.1.Legislation" data-unique="1.1.Legislation"></div><h3><a id="column-1" name="column-1"></a>1.1.

ANSSI is the authority responsible for assisting the Prime Minister in the exercise of his responsibilities in the field of defence and national security.</p><p>ANSSI has the following four objectives:</p><p>1. Monitoring cybersecurity incidents</p><p>ANSSI shall be notified directly by operators when a cyber incident occurs in a critical sector, essential sector, or affects a DSPs. ANSSI will provide support to the victim and then report the incident to sectoral ministries.</p><p>2. Security rules</p><p>ANSSI sets technical and organisational rules related mostly to cyber hygiene measures for any sector.</p><p>3. Controlling and inspecting</p><p>ANSSI triggers controls and inspections to be conducted by ANSSI directly or by an appointed service provider.</p><p>4.

Individuals can also fill a complaint with CNIL in case of issues regarding the protection of their personal data. In 2020, CNIL received 13,585 complaints and 121,439 phone calls.</p><p>2. Advising and providing compliance toolkits</p><p>CNIL may be consulted by public players on draft laws or decrees. CNIL's opinions are there to inform public authorities about data protection but cannot be considered as 'validation' or 'refusal'as they are only opinion and not legal decisions. CNIL's opinions can be seen as best practices and warnings about data protection.</p><p>3. Controlling and sanctioning</p><p>In the event of non-compliance to data protection rules, CNIL may decide to issue a formal notice or to sanction organizations (formal notice and/or fines). In 2020, CNIL issued 14 sanctions for a total amount of €138,489,300.</p><p>4.
