Legislation</h3><p>Banking and financial activities include the processing of a bank customers' personal data which has been collected in the context of banking and payment services. Information revealed by the use of payment instruments attached to the account makes it possible to find out the customer's consumption habits, travel habits and geographical location, and can lead institutions to learn more about particularly sensitive data. Moreover, the legislator imposes obligations on banking and financial institutions' collection and processing of data, for reasons of general interest, such as the fight against fraud, money laundering, and corruption, since such processing can also generate additional collection of personal data.

Legal basis for processing</h3><p>According to the GDPR, personal data must be processed in accordance with the principles of fairness, lawfulness and transparency (Article 5(1)(a) of the GDPR). In addition, processing shall only be lawful if (Article 6(1) of the GDPR):</p><ul><li>the data subject has given consent to the processing for one or more specific purpose;</li><li>the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of a data subject prior to entering a contract;</li><li>the processing is necessary for the compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject;</li><li>the processing is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person;</li><li>processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller; and</li><li>processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data.</li></ul><p>Moreover, under Article 9 of the GDPR, processing of special categories of personal data is prohibited unless one of the conditions in Article 9(2) applies. Financial data is not considered as sensitive data as per the GDPR meaning, however, in the Guidelines on Data Protection Impact Assessment (WP248 rev.01), the EDPBWP29 qualifies it as 'highly personal data', given the serious impact on data subjects that its violation could have.</p><p>The most relevant legal bases for the purposes of the financial sector in France are outlined below.</p><p><strong>Consent of the data subject: Article 6(1)(a) of the GDPR</strong></p><p>Article 4(11) of the GDPR defines the consent as 'any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject's wishes by which he or she, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her.' The <a href="https://www.dataguidance.com/legal-research/article-29-working-party-guidelines-consent" target="_blank">WP29 Guidelines on Consent under Regulation 2016/679 (updated 10 April 2018)</a> specify the conditions under which consent is considered valid.</p><p>In addition, Article L. 521-5 of the Monetary and Financial Code stipulates that payment service providers may only access, process, and store personal data necessary for the execution of their payment services with the express consent of the payment service user. Nevertheless, the EDPB, in its Letter regarding the PSD2 Directive (see section 1.1. above), considers that consent under PSD2 should be analysed as a contractual consent. The EDPB specifies that payment services are always provided on the basis of a contract between the payment service user and the payment service provider and considers that the notion of explicit consent provided for in Article 94 of PSD2 (transposed by the PSD2 Ordinance into Article L.521-5 of the Monetary and Financial Code) is an additional requirement of a contractual nature and is therefore not the same notion of consent provided for in Article 4(11) of the GDPR. This interpretation has been upheld in the subsequent guidelines on the interplay of the Second Payment Services Directive and the GDPR.</p><p><strong>Performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of data subject prior entering into a contract: Article 6(1)(b) GDPR</strong></p><p>A large number of processing activities in the financial services sector could use this lawful basis, such as processing personal data to open and manage bank accounts, to handle payments as instructed by a customer, and to update information concerning the account holders and characteristics of the operation of their accounts.</p><p><strong>Legal obligation to which the controller is subject: Article 6(1)(c) of the GDPR</strong></p><p>This legal basis can be used by financial institutions when they are required to report certain suspicious transactions to the competent authorities under anti-money laundering ('AML') rules. In France, financial institutions must report to a specialised body, <a href="https://www.economie.gouv.fr/tracfin" target="_blank">Tracfin</a>, any transaction or attempted transaction likely to constitute money laundering or terrorist financing ('ML/FT') (customer due diligence and reporting obligations under Articles L. 561-4-1 et seq. of the Monetary and Financial Code). In addition, CNIL has published a deliberation on a single authorisation for the processing of personal data by financial institutions relating anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism ('AML/CFT') and the application of financial sanctions on 16 June 2011. Although the single authorisations adopted by CNIL no longer have legal value since the entry into force of the GDPR, this document constitutes guidelines that should still be followed by financial institutions.</p><p>Another example is the processing that French financial institutions must implement within the framework of the <a href="https://platform.dataguidance.com/legal-research/fair-and-accurate-credit-transactions-act-2003-facta" target="_blank">Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act</a> ('FATCA'), since 1 July 2014, in order to identify 'US Person' and 'recalcitrant' customers, monitor the accounts concerned and compile a file containing the required data and documents. For these processing operations, French financial institutions may rely on their legal obligation under the FATCA.</p><p><strong>Legitimate interests pursued by the controller: Article 6(1)(e) and (f) of the GDPR</strong></p><p>Legitimate interest may also be an appropriate legal basis in the financial sector. In particular, the interest pursued by the controller is considered legitimate when the processing of the data relates only to limited and necessary information and is in line with normal practice in the sector of activities, which is reasonably expected by the data subjects.</p><p>Some processing may also rely on the public interest legal basis. This may be the case, for example, for processing whose purpose is to fight against financial fraud or the misuse of services.</p><div name="2.2.Privacynoticesandpolicies" data-unique="2.2.Privacynoticesandpolicies"></div><h3><a id="column-1" name="column-1"></a>2.2. Privacy notices and policies</h3><p>Pursuant to Article 5(1)(a) of the GDPR and the principle of transparency, concerned data subjects must be provided with certain information (typically referred to as a privacy notice or privacy policy). According to Articles 13 and 14 of the GDPR, such information must include, for example, the controller's identity and the contact details of the controller, the categories of personal data processed and the purposes of the processing, the recipients of the data, retention periods, and information concerning the existence of the data subject's rights.</p><p>In its various deliberations and publications, CNIL provides guidance on the information obligation set out in Articles 13 (where personal data is collected directly from the data subject) and 14 of the GDPR (where personal data is collected indirectly) without mentioning any specific requirements for the financial sector.</p><p>Nevertheless, some processing requires specific information to be provided to the data subjects. For example, in the case of a default payer list ('whitelist' or 'blacklist'), CNIL indicates that data subjects must be informed at several stages by the companies holding such lists of the existence of the list and the possibility to be registered in such list:</p><ul><li>information at the beginning of the relationship when the contract is concluded with the data subject or when the data collection takes place;</li><li>information, in the event of non-payment, of the means available to regularise the payment, the possibility and the means available to present observations and, if necessary, request a review of the situation;</li><li>information when the delay to regularise the payment has expired and information that the person is now registered in the default payers list; and</li><li>information when the default payment event is communicated to <a href="https://www.banque-france.fr/en" target="_blank">Bank of France</a> for registration to the FICP and, where relevant, to an outside collections agency.</li></ul><p>Where a list of individuals presenting a risk of fraud is established, the CNIL White Paper recommends the following two-stage process of informing the data subjects:</p><ul><li>general information of the data subjects about the existence of an anti-fraud mechanism that may lead to their inclusion on a list of individuals presenting a risk of fraud; and</li><li>if an anomaly, inconsistency, or alert likely to be related to fraud is detected, the data subject, likely to be recorded on this list, may be contacted, depending on the type of fraud suspected, in order to provide additional notification. At the end of the investigations, where a decision is taken and it has legal effects (such as the refusal to proceed with payment or the conclusion of a sales contract), a written and specific notification must be provided to the data subject, specifying the measures taken by the controller and giving the data subject the opportunity to present their observations.</li></ul><p>Article 14(5) of the GDPR provides for exceptions to the right to information, in particular where the provision of such information is likely to undermine the achievement of the purposes pursued by the controller. The WP29, in its <a href="https://platform.dataguidance.com/legal-research/guidelines-transparency-under-regulation-2016679-12-december-2017" target="_blank">Guidelines on Transparency within the Meaning of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of 27 November 2017</a>, indicated that the controller must demonstrate that the provision of the information under Article 14(1) of the GDPR would defeat the purposes of the processing operation. The WP29 takes as an example a bank which is required under AML legislation to report suspicious activity of some bank accounts to the financial law enforcement authorities. Under AML regulation, it is a criminal offence for a bank, while reporting a suspicion of fraud, to warn the holder of the account in question that it may be subject to investigation by the regulatory authorities. Thus, the exception in Article 14(5) GDPR can apply to the extent that the provision of the information to the data subject would seriously undermine the objectives of the legislation. The WP29 indicates that general information should be provided to all persons deciding to open an account, informing them that their personal data may be processed for AML purposes.</p><p>Lastly, in addition to the requirements relating to the information to be given to the data subjects, certain processing operations which are likely to be implemented in the financial sector require a Data Protection Impact Assessment ('DPIA'). The List of Types of Processing Operations for which an Data Protection Impact Assessment is Required (only available in French <a href="https://www.cnil.fr/sites/default/files/atoms/files/liste-traitements-aipd-requise.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>) ('the DPIA Blacklist'), established by CNIL on 22 October 2019, specifies that a DPIA must be carried out when:</p><ul><li>establishing a score for granting credit; and</li><li>the purpose of which is to fight against fraud in means of payment.</li></ul><div name="2.3.Datasecurityandriskmanagement" data-unique="2.3.Datasecurityandriskmanagement"></div><h3><a id="column-2" name="column-2"></a>2.3. Data security and risk management</h3><p>Taking into account the costs of implementation, nature, scope, context and purposes of processing, as well as the level of risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, data controllers and processors in the financial sector must implement technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk (Article 32 of the GDPR).</p><p>CNIL has specified its position in Deliberation No. 2018-303 of 6 September 2018 Adopting a Recommendation concerning the Processing of Credit Card Data for Online Sale of Goods or Provision of Services (only available in French <a href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000037477764&amp;categorieLien=id" target="_blank">here</a>), in which it states that cardholders must be informed of any compromise of their banking data so that they can take appropriate measures to limit the risks of fraudulent re-use of their card. CNIL also recommends the implementation of enhanced authentication means for the payment card holder to ensure that the cardholder is the originator of the remote payment transaction. In particular, the following measures are recommended:</p><ul><li>hide all or part of the card number when displaying or storing it;</li><li>replace the card number by a non-significant number; and</li><li>trace any illegitimate access or use of the data and attribute it to the person responsible.</li></ul><p>In addition, CNIL recommends that banks and card issuers offer data subjects the possibility to oppose:</p><ul><li>the use of Near Field Communication ('NFC') technology; or</li><li>the provision of a card with such technology.</li></ul><p>In Deliberation No. 2017-217 of 13 July 2017 on the Single Authorisation of Personal Data Processing for the Purpose of Combating External Fraud in the Banking and Financial Sector (only available in French <a href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000035268554&amp;categorieLien=id" target="_blank">here</a>), CNIL specifies that the controller must take all useful precautions to preserve the security of the data processed, in particular to prevent such data from being distorted, damaged or accessed by unauthorised third parties. In particular, maintenance operations must be traceable and stored equipment must be cleaned of any personal data. The conditions for the administration of the information system must provide for the existence of automatic traceability systems (logs, audits, etc.).</p><p>CNIL also issued, on 27 January 2017, guidance on specific password authentication rules (only available in French <a href="https://www.cnil.fr/en/node/23316" target="_blank">here</a>) in which it provides examples for online banks, with a minimum number of characters, special characters, additional identification means, etc. However, in a 2018 article (only available in French <a href="https://www.cnil.fr/fr/authentification-par-mot-de-passe-les-mesures-de-securite-elementaires" target="_blank">here</a>), the CNIL accepts that online banks offer number-only passwords as long as this criterion goes hand in hand with 'complementary measures' including the use of a unique identifier dedicated to the bank.</p><p>In addition, in January 2019, the ACPR published its Reflection Document on IT Risk (only available in French <a href="https://acpr.banque-france.fr/sites/default/files/medias/documents/819017_acpr_risque-informatique_fr_web.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>) that, among other things, clarifies the definition of information risk and cybersecurity, explaining to organisations what needs to be implemented to control IT risks, and outlining the role of the head of information systems security.</p><p>The ACPR and the ECB are also the authorities responsible for monitoring the correct application of the rules of PSD2 and the Commission Delegated Regulation on RTS for SCA and CSC. PSD2 and the Commission Delegated Regulation on RTS for SCA and CSC impose the following strict rules on security in the financial sector:</p><ul><li>Obligation of strong customer identification (Article 97 of PSD2; Article L. 133-44 of the Monetary and Financial Code): the payment service provider must implement strong authentication of the customer when he/she accesses his/her online payment account, initiates an electronic payment transaction or performs an action, or uses a remote means of communication, which is likely to involve a risk of payment fraud or any other fraudulent use. Since May 2021, France transposed the strong customer authentication ('SCA') standard as provided by the PSD2. SCA should be based on the use of two or more out of three elements: inherence, knowledge and possession. The inherence category (something the user is) generally falls under the qualification of biometric data and is protected by Article 9 of the GDPR. SCA is not required when the transaction is low risk (anti-fraud score, as calculated by the payment service, below a certain threshold) when it is less than €30 or results from a subscription, for instance.</li><li>Obligation to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of data<strong> </strong>(Articles 2 and 3 of the Commission Delegated Regulation): such obligations include authentication requirements (establishment of transaction control mechanisms to detect unauthorised or fraudulent payment transactions), and reviews of security measures by auditors with expertise in the field of IT security and independent electronic payments, etc.</li></ul><p>Lastly, sectoral standards such as the PCI DSS may apply.

The period for which the personal data is stored should be limited to a minimum and time limits should be established by the controller for erasure or a periodic review (Recital 39 of the GDPR).</p><p>At the European level, several regulations provide for limited retention periods. For instance, Article 25 of MiFIR states that investment firms shall keep at the disposal of the competent authorities, for a period of five years, the relevant data relating to all orders and transactions in financial instruments which they have executed, whether for own account or on behalf of a client.</p><p>The GDPR also provides that personal data must not be retained in a form which permits the identification of the data subject for longer than is necessary for the purposes the data was processed (Article 5(1)(e) of the GDPR) and that the period for which the personal data are stored should be limited to a strict minimum, and to these ends, time limits should be established by the controller for erasure or a periodic review (Recital 39 of the GDPR).</p><p>Data protection authorities also provide for some guidelines. For instance, concerning personal data processed for the purpose of combatting external fraud in the banking and financial sector, CNIL specifies that entities have a period of 12 months from the issuance of alerts to qualify them. Any alert qualified as irrelevant must be deleted without delay. Alerts that have not received any qualification at the end of the 12-month period must also be deleted at the end of such period. In the case of a relevant alert, the data relating to the proven fraud shall be kept for a maximum period of five years from the closure of the fraud case. When legal proceedings are initiated, data is kept until the end of the legal proceedings and is then archived according to the applicable legal limitation periods.</p><p>CNIL also recalls certain retention periods are recommended for remote payment via bank card in its Deliberation No. 2018-303 of 6 September 2018 Adopting a Recommendation on the Processing of Banking Card Data in the context of the Sale of Goods or Provision of Services Remotely and Repealing Deliberation No. 2017-222 of 20 July 2017 (only available in French <a href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/jorf/id/JORFTEXT000037477764" target="_blank">here</a>):</p><ul><li>for a single payment, payment card data may be retained until the payment is complete or until the receipt of the goods or the performance of the service (and as the case may be, increased by the duration of the withdrawal period).</li><li>in the case of subscriptions involving instalment payments, banking details may be kept for as long as it is justified:&nbsp;</li><li>until the last payment's due date, if the subscription does not provide for tacit renewal;</li><li>until the termination of the subscription in case of tacit renewal, subject to the applicable provisions and in particular the information of the persons concerned before the renewal.</li><li>for claims management, data may be kept for 13 months from the date of debit or 15 months in the case of deferred debit cards.

Banking Secrecy and Confidentiality</h2><p>Banking secrecy is provided for in Article L. 511-33 of the Monetary and Financial Code and applies to any member of a board of directors and, as the case may be, of a supervisory board and to any person who participates in the management or administration of a credit institution, enterprises established in France and which are part of a financial group or a group comprising at least one financial company, as well as financial holding companies, parent companies of finance companies, mixed financial holding companies, financial conglomerates, mixed holding companies and mixed parent companies of finance companies. Banking secrecy also applies to persons who, in the course of their duties, may be confronted with or collect confidential information, as is the case for members of the ACPR or for the employees of the Bank of France.</p><p>In several decisions about banking secrecy, the highest civil court in the French judiciary, the <a href="https://www.courdecassation.fr/" target="_blank">Court of Cassation</a>, refers to Article 9 of the <a href="https://platform.dataguidance.com/legal-research/civil-code" target="_blank">Civil Code</a>, which states that 'everyone has the right to respect for his/her private life,'<em> </em>underlining that banking secrecy is intended in particular to protect clients from the disclosure of information relating to their private life.</p><p>However, this secret is not absolute and interests other than privacy may justify third-party access to clients' banking data. There are indeed certain exceptions to banking secrecy, notably for files setting up an information system relating to payment incidents and incidents involving the repayment of loans to individuals. Moreover, banking secrecy may not be invoked against the ACPR, Bank of France or judicial authorities acting in the context of criminal proceedings. Credit institutions may also communicate information covered by professional secrecy to rating agencies for the purposes of rating financial products and to the persons with whom they negotiate, conclude or execute certain transactions listed in Article L. 511-33 of the Monetary and Financial Code. Credit institutions may nevertheless communicate information covered by professional secrecy only on a case-by-case basis and only when the data subjects have expressly allowed them to do so.</p><p>In addition, the communication of documents covered by banking secrecy must only be authorised if it is indispensable for the exercise by the applicant of his or her right to evidence and proportionate to the conflicting interests involved.</p><div name="5.Insurance" data-unique="5.Insurance"></div><h2><a id="column-6" name="column-6"></a>5.

Payment Services</h2><p>PSD2 was adopted on 25 November 2015 to adapt 'the regulatory framework for payment services to the challenges posed by the emergence of innovative services, the rapid growth of electronic payments and the sustained pace of technical innovation.' It was transposed into law by the PSD2 Ordinance.</p><p>In addition, the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/index_en" target="_blank">European Commission</a> ('the Commission'), in the Commission Delegated Regulation on RTS for SCA and CSC, adopted regulatory technical standards that provide a framework for the measures to be put in place to ensure greater security of electronic payments. It requires that customer payment account data be accessible and free of charge for:</p><ul><li>the account information service: the data aggregation service that provides customers holding payment accounts at one or more institutions with consolidated information; and</li><li>payment initiation service: this enables a payment service provider to transmit a payment order, in the name and on behalf of the customer, to the account-holding institution.</li></ul><p>It thus provides for registration (for aggregators) or authorisation (for payment initiators) obligations. In France, these new players are supervised by the ACPR. With regard to the customer, the account holder (i.e. the bank or payment institution where the customer has his account) has the obligation, in the event of fraud based on a payment initiation, to reimburse the customer. This new liability regime places the burden of the fraud on the account keeper, whatever the origin of the fraud, and requires him to turn to the payment initiator who is subject to an insurance obligation.</p><p>PSD2 highlights new risks introduced by innovation and the multiplication of stakeholders and states in its Recital No. 95 that 'the security of electronic payments is fundamental to ensure the protection of users and the development of a healthy environment for electronic commerce. All payment services offered by electronic means should be secure, using technologies that ensure secure user authentication and reduce, as far as possible, the risk of fraud.'</p><p>Article 98 of PSD2 entrusted the experts of the EBA with the task of defining regulatory technical standards for strong customer authentication for payment transactions and access to online payment accounts. In France, the Bank of France is in charge of ensuring the security of access to payment accounts and their information in the context of the provision of payment services as well as the relevance of the applicable standards in this area.</p><p>These security standards are based on a standardised and secure method of access open to all players. The account-keeping banks must therefore provide payment aggregators and initiators with a standardised and secure interface.</p><div name="7.DataTransfersandOutsourcing" data-unique="7.DataTransfersandOutsourcing"></div><h2><a id="column-8" name="column-8"></a>7.

Regarding the financial sector, compatible purposes must be assessed very strictly, taking into account the particular sensitivity of the data. PSD2 imposes limitations on the re-use of data in addition to the criteria set out in the GDPR. Pursuant to Articles 66 and 67 of the PSD2, any purpose other than the provision of an account information service or a payment initiation service is not considered as a compatible purpose. Providers of these services must therefore obtain the prior consent of the data subjects to process the data for other purposes (unless such further processing is required by Union or Member State law in accordance with Article 6(4) of the GDPR).</p><p>At the French level, the Monetary and Financial Code lays down the rules for the transfer of data between payment service providers and, in particular, specifies that payment service providers managing the account may refuse a payment service provider for objectively justified and documented reasons relating to unauthorised or fraudulent access to the payment account and only access, process and store personal data necessary for the execution of their payment services with the express consent of the payment service user.</p><div name="8.BreachNotification" data-unique="8.BreachNotification"></div><h2><a id="column-9" name="column-9"></a>8.

A definition of an ICO along with a definition of 'token' have thus been introduced in the of the Monetary and Financial Code (art. L. 552-2 and L. 522-3). Thus, a token is defined as 'any intangible asset representing, in digital form, one or more rights, which may be issued, registered, held or transferred by means of a shared electronic recording device enabling the owner of the asset to be identified directly or indirectly.' ICO project owners who wish to do so may submit their information document to an optional visa issued by the AMF provided that they meet certain requirements (insurance or own funds, internal control procedures, resilient IT system, transparent pricing policy…).</p><p>In addition, the law provides with a specific regime framing digital asset service providers ('PSAN'). A PSAN must be registered with the AMF in order to offer the services of:</p><ul><li>storage of digital assets on behalf of third parties; and</li><li>purchase/sale of crypto-assets for legal tender currencies.</li></ul><p>For other activities (e.g. the operation of a digital asset trading platform, portfolio management) the registration is only optional.</p><p>Crowdfunding operations may be offered by different actors depending on the nature of the investment. Intermediary in crowdfunding activities cover loans, interest-free loans and donations through an online platform. IFPs are supervised by the ACPR.</p><p>To offer equity, bonds or 'minibons' (non-negotiable securities involving an undertaking by a merchant to pay on a specified date, issued in consideration of a loan and offered by means of a website that meets the characteristics set by the AMF, article L. 223-6 of the Monetary and Financial Code) the provider must be certified as an investment crowdfunding advisor by the AMF or as an investment service provider.</p><p>However, the <a href="https://www.dataguidance.com/legal-research/eu-regulation-eu-20201503-european-parliament" target="_blank">EU Regulation (EU) 2020/1503 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 October 2020 on European crowdfunding service providers for business</a> creates a single European status for providers of investment crowdfunding services, subject to approval by the competent authority. This status will replace the existing IFP and CIP regimes.</p><div name="10.Enforcement" data-unique="10.Enforcement"></div><h2><a id="column-10" name="column-10"></a>10.
