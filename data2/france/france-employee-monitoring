Since the implementation of the GDPR, this simplified standard no longer has legal value. However, CNIL has decided to keep the Simplified Norm accessible as a means to assist data controllers in their compliance efforts.</p><p>Today, the Guidance on Workplace Telephone Surveillance contains the main rules applicable to the listening and recording of telephone conversations. It builds upon the Simplified Norm and modernises its content in light of the GDPR.</p><div name="2.2.Forwhichpurposesmayanemployercarryoutthistypeofmonitoring?" data-unique="2.2.Forwhichpurposesmayanemployercarryoutthistypeofmonitoring?"></div><h3>2.2. For which purposes may an employer carry out this type of monitoring?</h3><p>According to the Guidance on Workplace Telephone Surveillance, the temporary listening and/or recording of telephone conversations in the workplace is permitted for the following purposes:</p><ul><li>for the training of employees (e.g. to re-use the recordings as training materials);</li><li>for the assessment/appraisal of employees;</li><li>to improve the quality of the service; and</li><li>in certain cases, provided for by a legal provision, telephone calls may be used as evidence for the existence or execution of a contract or performance of a transaction.</li></ul><p>Documents, such as minutes or analyses, can be drawn up from the call recordings as long as they fulfil one of the above-listed purposes.</p><p>However, employers can only collect and process the personal data that are necessary for the above purposes, such as identification data relating to the employee or the assessor, and technical data relating to the call and professional assessment of the employees.</p><p>The collection/processing of sensitive data and the permanent and systematic recording of employees (including for purposes of maintaining evidence) are not permitted.</p><p>In addition, CNIL highlights in its Guidance on Video Recording or Screenshots Coupled with Telephone Conversation Recordings at Work (17 September 2019) (only available in French <a href="https://www.cnil.fr/fr/lenregistrement-video-ou-la-capture-decran-couple-lenregistrement-des-conversations-telephoniques" target="_blank">here</a>) that the combination of telephone recordings with screenshots taken from an employee's computer is also in principle prohibited. CNIL considers that this practice is not proportionate, regardless of the purpose pursued. However, the combination of telephone recordings with the video recordings of the employee's screen â€“ as opposed to instantaneous screenshots â€“ is permitted, provided that the following conditions are followed:</p><ul><li>employees are duly informed about this combination;</li><li>the video recording of the employee's screen is limited to the tab(s) of the business application to which the training relates;</li><li>the video recording of the employee's screen only starts when the employee picks up the phone and until they&nbsp;hang&nbsp;up;</li><li>this system should only apply to employees who have a real need for training on a business application or software, i.e. inexperienced employees or beginners;</li><li>the volume of recordings should also be proportionate to the training need and strictly limited to the capacity to analyse these recordings for training purposes - for example, dozens of calls should not be recorded if only a small number of calls are analysed in the end;</li><li>employees can only be trained on the basis of their own video recordings unless the other video recordings are anonymised;</li><li>access to the recordings must be restricted to authorised individuals and access traceability (logging system) must be implemented; and</li><li>all the specific safeguards that are applicable to the recording of telephone conversations should be implemented, e.g. a separate telephone line should be provided to staff representatives, employees should be able to take personal calls without being recorded, and the applicable retention period mentioned below should be applied.</li></ul><p>It should be noted that CNIL considers that the combination of telephone recordings with video recordings can only be justified for training purposes. Such combination would be disproportionate for other purposes, such as combatting internal fraud or conducting employee appraisals.</p><div name="2.3.Ispriornotification/approvalwiththedataprotectionauthorityrequired?" data-unique="2.3.Ispriornotification/approvalwiththedataprotectionauthorityrequired?"></div><h3><a id="column-6" name="column-6"></a>2.3. Is prior notification/approval with the data protection authority required?</h3><p>Since the implementation of the GDPR, prior notification/approval with CNIL is no longer required. In France, only certain sectors still require notification/approval (e.g. request for an opinion for the police/justice sectors or request for authorisation for some health data processing activities), however recording of telephone conversations is not listed as one of them.</p><p>Employers should therefore make sure that they comply with the relevant provisions of the GDPR, including the obligation to maintain a record of processing activities, to implement Data Protection by Design and to carry out a Data Protection Impact Assessment ('DPIA') if their processing is likely to result in a high risk for the rights and freedoms of individuals. Furthermore, CNIL especially provides, in its <a href="https://platform.dataguidance.com/legal-research/france-dpia-blacklist" target="_blank">Deliberation No. 2018-327 of 11 October 2018 on the Adoption of the List of Processing Operations for which a DPIA is Required</a><u> (</u>'the DPIA Blacklist'), that companies have to carry out a DPIA for processing carried out for the purpose of systematic monitoring of employees' activities, such as the monitoring of employees' telephones.</p><p>Note that in its Guidance on Workplace Telephone Surveillance, CNIL requires that any telephone monitoring activity in the workplace is entered in the record of processing activities within the meaning of Article 30 of the GDPR.</p><div name="2.4.Ispriornotification/approval/consultationfromworks'councilsrequired?" data-unique="2.4.Ispriornotification/approval/consultationfromworks'councilsrequired?"></div><h3><a id="column-7" name="column-7"></a>2.4.

Is there a legal requirement for employers to have a written policy in place governing telephone monitoring?</h3><p>Yes, pursuant to Article 13 of the GDPR, to which Article 48 of the Act refers, employers must inform their employees about the processing of their personal data, the purposes of the processing, the recipients of the telephone recordings (or any other data collected), their rights to object, to access, to rectify and to erase the recordings, the retention period, and any transfers of personal data outside the European Economic Area ('EEA'). Employees should also be informed about the possibility of filing a complaint with CNIL.</p><p>Lastly, the Act requires that data subjects are informed about their right to provide instructions to the data controller on what will happen to their personal data after their death (see Articles 48 and 85 of the Act).</p><p>Note that the Guidance on Workplace Telephone Surveillance clarifies that in light of the case law of the Court of Cassation regarding social matters, employees must be informed of the periods during which they are likely to be listened to or recorded.</p><p>In practice, this can be done in an employee privacy policy or in a privacy notice that is delivered to the employee before using a recording device.

Analysis documents (e.g. reports or analysis charts and tables) that may be developed in relation to telephone recordings, may be retained for up to one year. In the Guidance on Workplace Telephone Surveillance, CNIL considers the use of 'buffer records' as a good practice (i.e. to listen to the recordings within days of their completion and to write the analysis document) in the sense that it allows the records to be deleted on short notice, with the employer retaining only the analysis document.</p><div name="3.CCTV" data-unique="3.CCTV"></div><h2>3. CCTV</h2><div name="3.1.WhataretherulesforCCTVsurveillance?" data-unique="3.1.WhataretherulesforCCTVsurveillance?"></div><h3>3.1. What are the rules for CCTV surveillance?</h3><p>CCTV cameras are subject to two different legal regimes, depending on whether the cameras are placed in a public area or a 'place open to the public', or a private area closed to the public.</p><p>A 'private area' is defined as any area belonging to the private or the public sector that is not open to the public (e.g. office spaces, a parking lot reserved to employees of a company, a storage facility, etc.). When placed in a private area, the recording, viewing and storage of CCTV footage constitutes a data processing activity.</p><p>According to established case law, a place open to the public is 'a place accessible to all, without special authorisation from anyone, whether access is permanent and unconditional or subject to certain conditions' (TGI Paris, 23 October 1986, Gaz. Pal. 8 January 1987).</p><div name="3.2.Forwhichpurposesmayanemployercarryoutthistypeofmonitoring?" data-unique="3.2.Forwhichpurposesmayanemployercarryoutthistypeofmonitoring?"></div><h3>3.2. For which purposes may an employer carry out this type of monitoring?</h3><p>CCTV cameras must be used only when justified by a lawful and legitimate purpose. In the workplace, the use of CCTV cameras is usually justified by the need to maintain the security of the people and premises, as a deterrent, or to preserve evidence of any thefts or damage that may occur on the premises.</p><p>CCTV cameras must only be used in a non-intrusive manner. For example, CCTV cameras may be used for security purposes and placed at the entrance and exit of a building, in front of emergency exits, or in the main halls and corridors of the building. They may also be used to film storage facilities in order to guarantee the safety of goods or valuables. However, cameras must not be placed inside office areas pointing at employees or directly above the desks of employees working in open spaces. Cameras cannot be used to film employees at their workstations, except in specific circumstances, such as cashiers handling money - however, the camera must be pointed at the counter rather than at the employees themselves - or when valuables are stored in a warehouse within which warehousemen work. It is also strictly prohibited to place cameras inside restrooms, recreational areas, premises that are reserved for employee representatives and trade unions, or pointing at the entrance to such premises.</p><p>Before installing a video surveillance system, companies must assess the potential risks (depending on the number of cameras used, the areas under surveillance, the hours of use, the purpose of use, etc.) and ensure that the cameras are used for a legitimate purpose and in a proportionate manner. If a data protection officer ('DPO') has been appointed by companies, they&nbsp;must be involved with respect to the video surveillance system.</p><p>CNIL provides that companies have to conduct a DPIA for processing operations in case of permanent monitoring of the activities of the concerned employees. If a DPO has been appointed by companies, they&nbsp;must be involved with respect to the establishment of the DPIA. In short, in situations where employees are being monitored on a permanent basis, a DPIA must be carried out.</p><div name="3.3.Ispriornotification/approvalwiththedataprotectionauthorityrequired?" data-unique="3.3.Ispriornotification/approvalwiththedataprotectionauthorityrequired?"></div><h3><a id="column-13" name="column-13"></a>3.3. Is prior notification/approval with the data protection authority required?</h3><p>As of 25 May 2018, prior notification/approval with the data protection authority is no longer required. In France, only certain sectors still require notification/approval (e.g. request for an opinion for the police/justice sectors or request for authorisation for certain health data processing activities), however CCTV surveillance is not listed as one of them.</p><p>Employers should make sure they comply with the provisions of the GDPR, including the obligation to maintain a record of processing activities, to implement Data Protection by Design and to carry out a DPIA if the processing is likely to result in a 'high risk' for the rights and freedoms of individuals. In particular, as explained in section 3.2 above, a DPIA must be carried out in case of monitoring of employees on a permanent basis.</p><p>Note that in its Guidance on Video Surveillance in the Workplace, CNIL requires that any CCTV monitoring activity in the workplace is entered in the record of processing activities within the meaning of Article 30 of the GDPR.</p><p>Lastly, it should be noted that if the CCTV cameras are placed in a public area (e.g. counters, entrance and exit for the public), they must obtain the prior authorisation of the local administrative power.

Is there a legal requirement for employers to have a written policy in place governing CCTV surveillance?</h3><p>Yes, pursuant to Article 13 of the GDPR, to which Article 48 of the Act refers, employers must inform their employees about the processing of their personal data, the recipients of the CCTV footage, their rights to object to, to access, to rectify and to erase such footage, the retention period and any transfers of personal data outside the EEA. Employees should also be informed about the possibility to file a complaint with CNIL. Lastly, the Act requires employers to inform data subjects about their right to provide instructions to the data controller on what will happen to their personal after their death (see Articles 48 and 85 of the Act). In practice, this can be done in an employee privacy policy and CNIL requires each employee to be individually informed about the existence of the surveillance system. Please note that under the Labour Code, it is also prohibited to collect any information about an employee by using a device that has not been brought to their attention (see L.1222-4 of the Labour Code).</p><p>Furthermore, employers must notify their employees and any visitors of the premises about the use of CCTV cameras. In practice, this can be done by prominently displaying a notice on the premises where the cameras are placed. In its Guidance on Video Surveillance in the Workplace, CNIL recommends displaying a visible sign informing of the existence of the device, the name of the person in charge of the surveillance activity, the purposes of the processing, the period of retention of the CCTV footage, the name or function and the contact details of the person in charge or the DPO, the existence of the data protection rights and the possibility to submit a complaint to CNIL, as well as CNIL's contact information.</p><p>The CCTV signage should refer to the second level information which can be accessible via a website. This must provide for the legal basis of the processing, the recipients of the personal data, whether these recipients are based outside of the EU, and any other necessary additional information (e.g. profiling, automated decision-making).</p><p>Finally, the EDPB's Guidelines on Video Devices include a section on the information to be provided to data subjects.</p><div name="3.7.Arethereanyexemptions?" data-unique="3.7.Arethereanyexemptions?"></div><h3><a id="column-17" name="column-17"></a>3.7.

As a general rule, CNIL recommends retaining the CCTV images for several days and no longer than one month, except if they are used in the context of disciplinary or legal procedure, in which case the relevant CCTV images may be extracted from the recordings and retained for the duration of such proceedings.</p><p>In recent sanction proceedings (only available in French <a href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCnil.do?oldAction=rechExpCnil&amp;id=CNILTEXT000038629823&amp;fastReqId=946473298&amp;fastPos=1" target="_blank">here</a>), CNIL ordered a company to retain the CCTV images for no more than 15 days.</p><div name="4.Email" data-unique="4.Email"></div><h2>4.

What are the rules regarding monitoring of employees' emails?</h3><p>Companies may be required to investigate an employee for a number of reasons, for example, where an employee is suspected of fraud or of violating the company's internal policies. In order to obtain and retain evidence of that employee's wrongdoing, the company may need to search the employee's email inbox and computer files.</p><p>The rules on privacy in the workplace are largely based on case law, particularly the rulings of the Court of Cassation. In <em>Nikon</em>, it held that 'an employee has the right to the respect of their private life - including the right to the secrecy of correspondence - on the work premises and during working hours.' The Court of Cassation's ruling is based on Article 9 of the Civil Code, which states that 'Any person has the right to the respect for their&nbsp;private life.' Since then, the Court of Cassation has refined its position and considers that emails and documents stored on a computer owned by the company are presumed to be professional by nature, unless they are clearly marked by the employee as being private.</p><p>According to the CNIL in its Guidance on IT Tools in the Workplace, the employer cannot receive an automatic copy of all messages written or received by its employees, as this form of monitoring would be considered excessive.</p><div name="4.2.Forwhichpurposesmayanemployercarryoutthistypeofmonitoring?" data-unique="4.2.Forwhichpurposesmayanemployercarryoutthistypeofmonitoring?"></div><h3>4.2. For which purposes may an employer carry out this type of monitoring?</h3><p>Further to the above, this means that the use of emailing systems in the workplace is presumed to be professional, thus allowing an employer to monitor an employee's emails. On the contrary, emails that are marked as 'private' in their subject line or those that are stored in a sub-folder of the inbox marked 'private,' are considered private correspondence and cannot be accessed by the employer without notifying the employee concerned, unless there is a particular risk or threat for the company. The concept of a risk or threat for the company is not clearly defined by case law, but it is generally meant as exceptional circumstances (e.g. a security threat that could cause a breach of the company's IT systems and the origin of the threat needs to be located on an employee's working station).</p><p>However, the emails sent through a personal mailbox that is distinct from the professional one and that is accessible from the employee's professional computer are not presumed to be professional. These emails are private even if they are not identified as such. This principle was recently reaffirmed by the Court of Cassation <em>Mme P v sociÃ©tÃ© Iâ€¦ Nâ€¦</em> (Case No. 17-28448 of 23 October 2019) (only available in French <a href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichJuriJudi.do?idTexte=JURITEXT000039307321" target="_blank">here</a>).</p><div name="4.3.Ispriornotification/approvalwiththedataprotectionauthorityrequired?" data-unique="4.3.Ispriornotification/approvalwiththedataprotectionauthorityrequired?"></div><h3><a id="column-19" name="column-19"></a>4.3.

In the context of email monitoring, CNIL provides the example of cyber surveillance devices such as those that analyse outgoing email flows to detect possible information leaks. In short, in situations where emails are being monitored on an ongoing basis, a DPIA must be carried out.</p><p>Note that in its Guidance on Video Surveillance in the Workplace, CNIL requires that any email monitoring activity at the workplace is listed in the record of processing activities within the meaning of Article 30 of the GDPR.

In such case, a company cannot ask its IT administrator to disclose an employee's login and password in order to access the employee's computer during their&nbsp;absence, even if such access is limited to professional files. The employer must set the conditions for checking employee mailboxes while absent. These rules may for example be set out in a company's IT charter.

Biometrics</h2><div name="5.1.Whataretherulesregardingbiometricmonitoring?" data-unique="5.1.Whataretherulesregardingbiometricmonitoring?"></div><h3>5.1. What are the rules regarding biometric monitoring?</h3><p>Biometric data is strictly regulated by the Act. Biometric data that is used to identify an individual is considered as sensitive personal data within the meaning of Article 6 of the Act and Article 9 of the GDPR. The processing of such sensitive data is in principle prohibited, except in certain limited cases. To this end, the French Legislator introduced a specific provision at Article 44(4) of the Act, allowing employers to process biometric data that are strictly necessary to control access to the work premises if such processing complies with the Regulation on Biometric Access Controls in the Workplace.</p><p>On 28 March 2019, CNIL published the Regulation on Biometric Access Controls in the Workplace, and issued a press release on the same topic (only available in French <a href="https://www.cnil.fr/fr/biometrie-sur-les-lieux-de-travail-publication-dun-reglement-type" target="_blank">here</a>) as well as a Q&amp;A (only available in French <a href="https://www.cnil.fr/fr/question-reponses-sur-le-reglement-type-biometrie" target="_blank">here</a>), specifying the obligations of organisations wishing to acquire biometric devices for the purpose of controlling access to work premises and work tools.</p><p>In essence, employers must demonstrate and document the need to use biometric data processing. The Regulation on Biometric Access Controls in the Workplace requires proof that the use of other identification devices (badges, passwords, etc.), or other technical and organisational measures, do not meet the required level of security. Similarly, employers must justify the choice of one biometric feature over another (iris, fingerprint, hand venous network, etc.). Note that CNIL strictly prohibits biometric authentication requiring biological sampling (saliva, blood, etc.).</p><p>In addition, the Regulation on Biometric Access Controls in the Workplace distinguishes three types of biometric devices depending on the degree of control exercised by the employees over the biometric template storage medium:</p><ul><li>Type one: template under the employee's exclusive control (no copy of the biometric template can be kept by the employer or service providers);</li><li>Type two: template under employee and employer shared control; and</li><li>Type three: template under the employer's exclusive control.</li></ul><p>CNIL favours Type one&nbsp;storage, whereas Types two and three&nbsp;must remain exceptional and be justified and documented by specific and substantiated considerations.</p><p>Lastly, the Regulation on Biometric Access Controls in the Workplace requires employers to comply with strict specifications regarding technical and organisational security measures to preserve the availability, integrity and confidentiality of the processed biometric data.</p><div name="5.2.Forwhichpurposesmayanemployercarryoutthistypeofmonitoring?" data-unique="5.2.Forwhichpurposesmayanemployercarryoutthistypeofmonitoring?"></div><h3>5.2.

Covert Surveillance</h2><p>The covert surveillance of employees is prohibited and both employees and the social and economic committee must be informed prior to installing any employee monitoring device. The violation of the right to secrecy of correspondence, including electronic correspondence, is a criminal offence under Article 226-15 of the Penal Code.</p><p><strong>Surveillance during remote working</strong></p><p>Even though surveillance during remote working may not fall exactly under 'covert surveillance, in its recent Q&amp;A on Working from Home, CNIL took the opportunity to recall a few blacklisted practices that employers should not implement, even when employees work from home. Indeed, CNIL seeks, in Q&amp;A on Working from Home, to draw employers' attention to the fact that they are not allowed to place their employees under permanent monitoring (except in exceptional cases duly justified by the nature of the work, as stated by the labour law courts and the Labour Code).</p><p>As such, CNIL considers that the following examples do not appear to be compliant:</p><ul><li>constant surveillance by means of video (such as a webcam) or audio devices. This would be the case if an employer was asking an employee to use videoconferencing throughout their&nbsp;working hours to ensure their&nbsp;presence behind the screen. Such a system placing employees under permanent surveillance is excessive and cannot be implemented according to CNIL;</li><li>permanent sharing of the screen and/or the use of 'keyloggers' (software that records all keystrokes made by a person on a computer). Such processes are particularly invasive and amount to permanent and disproportionate monitoring of employees' activities; and</li><li>the obligation for the employees to carry out very regular actions to demonstrate their presence behind their screen, such as clicking every X minutes on an application or taking photos at regular intervals.</li></ul><p>However, the implementation of any device which is strictly proportionate to the objective pursued by the employer remains possible during the working from home period, subject to compliance with the standard employer obligations and respect for employee rights and freedoms. By way of illustration, the Court of Cassation, in Case No. 18-24.758 of 26 February 2020 (only available in French <a href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/juri/id/JURITEXT000041701850" target="_blank">here</a>) recalled that the use of an employer's new working time management software should be suspended, with regard to the counting of working hours, where the social and economic committee has not been informed and consulted on the introduction of this tool.</p><div name="8.Employees'AccessRights" data-unique="8.Employees'AccessRights"></div><h2>8. Employees' Access Rights</h2><p>Employee data subjects' rights include the rights to access, to object, to rectify, and to erase the data collected. More specifically, employees have a right to obtain confirmation that personal data about them is being processed, to access their personal data and they may request a copy of any personal data that is held about them by their employer. Employees may also request that their data be updated, corrected or deleted if it is obsolete, incorrect or outdated. Employees may also object, based on legitimate grounds, to the processing of their personal data, except where the processing satisfies a legal obligation or has been authorised by CNIL. Lastly, employees should be advised about the possibility to file a complaint with CNIL.</p><p>In the Guidelines on Access to the Professional File (only available in French <a href="https://www.cnil.fr/fr/lacces-son-dossier-professionnel" target="_blank">here</a>), CNIL provides a non-exhaustive list of example that employees may request from their employer, which includes notably the right to access the data related to the use of their badge to control access to the premises.</p><p>Very recently in its Guidance on Employees' Right of Access, CNIL provided practical recommendations on how employers should respond to the exercise of the right of access by their current or former employees. In particular, CNIL recalled that the right of access to employees' personal data does not constitute a right to access documents <em>per se</em>, in line with the <a href="https://european-union.europa.eu/institutions-law-budget/institutions-and-bodies/institutions-and-bodies-profiles/court-justice-european-union-cjeu_en">Court of Justice of the European Union</a>'s case law on that topic. In addition, CNIL differentiated the scenario where the concerned employee is a recipient or sender of the emails that are in-scope of the access request from the scenario where the concerned employee is neither the recipient nor the sender and is simply mentioned in the body of the email. In the first case, CNIL considers that employers should provide a copy of the metadata and the content of the email, except in exceptional circumstances. In doing so, it is assumed that the communication of such emails does not violate third parties' rights. In such a case, anonymisation and pseudonymisation constitute a best practice but are not mandatory. In the second case, CNIL considers that the employer must assess whether retrieving such emails does not entail a disproportionate interference to third parties' rights and if the content of the emails interferes with such third parties' rights. Anonymisation and pseudonymisation are necessary in this case.</p><div name="9.Penalties" data-unique="9.Penalties"></div><h2><a id="column-5" name="column-5"></a>9.
