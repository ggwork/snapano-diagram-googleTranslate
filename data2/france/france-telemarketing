Definitions</h2><p><strong>Marketing calls</strong>: There is no definition of 'marketing calls' in French law. However, Article L221-16 of the Consumer Code refers to a professional who contacts a consumer's telephone to conclude a contract for the sale of goods or the supply of a service.</p><p><strong>Consent</strong>: Any free, specific, and informed demonstration of will by which a person agrees to the use of personal data concerning them for direct marketing purposes (Article L34-5 of the Communications Code). It must be obtained through a positive act by the individual (Article 4 (11) of the GDPR, the Referential).</p><div name="3.ConsentRequirements" data-unique="3.ConsentRequirements"></div><h2>3. Consent Requirements</h2><div name="3.1.B2C" data-unique="3.1.B2C"></div><h3><a id="column-3" name="column-3"></a>3.1. B2C</h3><p>The Consumer Code distinguishes between person to person and automated calls in the business to consumer ('B2C') context.</p><p><strong>Person to person calls</strong></p><p>Organisations are not required to obtain prior consent from the recipient when making person to person telemarketing calls, provided that at the time of collection of the individual's telephone number, the individual was informed of the use of the telephone number for marketing purposes and was given the opportunity to oppose to such use in a free and simple way, including through the use of a checkbox (the Telemarketing Guidance).</p><p>Organisations, when collecting telephone data from an individual, must inform the individual of their right to register on the opt-out list for telephones. If the collection of information is made at the time of the conclusion of a contract, the contract must mention, clearly and understandably, the existence of this right for the individual (Article L223-2 of the Consumer Code and the Bloctel Guidance).</p><p>If the organisation collecting such data intends to share it with other organisations, it must grant the individual with specific information, including the purpose and the categories of recipients. The individual must be allowed to oppose such use in a free and simple way, including through the use of a checkbox (the Telemarketing Guidance).</p><p>If the data has not been collected directly from the individual but through a third party, the individual must be given information, at the latest on the first contact with the individual, on the identity of the organisation calling, of the purpose, and of the means to exercise their rights, as well as the source of the data (the Telemarketing Guidance).</p><p><strong>Automated calls</strong></p><p>Organisations are required to obtain the prior consent of the recipients before making automated telemarketing calls (Article L223-7 of Consumer Code and Article L34-5 of the Communications Code).</p><div name="3.2.B2B" data-unique="3.2.B2B"></div><h3><a id="column-4" name="column-4"></a>3.2. B2B</h3><p>The Consumer Code also distinguishes between person to person and automated calls in the business to business ('B2B') context.</p><p><strong>Person to person calls</strong></p><p>Organisations are not required to obtain prior consent when making B2B telemarketing calls to the main company telephone number, or to the specific number of an employee of that legal person (opt-out). Telemarketing is possible privded that the person is, at the time of collection of their telephone number:</p><ul><li>informed of its use for marketing purposes; and</li><li>able to oppose to this use in a free and simple way, including through a checkbox.</li></ul><p>The individual must also be informed, if applicable, that their data may be shared with other organisations and the purposes of this sharing and the categories of recipients.</p><p><strong>Automated calls</strong></p><p>Prior consent is not required when making automated B2B telemarketing calls to the general number of a business/legal entity (opt-out).</p><p>Legal documentation is particularly silent on automated telemarketing calls to specific employees of a legal entity. However, CNIL tends to consider that prior consent is necessary with respect to natural persons. As a consequence, advertising via automated calling machines is possible provided that the persons (including employees) have explicitly agreed to be approached, at the time of the collection of their phone number (opt-in).</p><p>Moreover, in the context of marketing of a charitable or associative nature, the person must, at the time of collection of their telephone number:</p><ul><li>be informed of its use for marketing purposes; and</li><li>able to oppose to this use in a free and simple and way, including through a checkbox.</li></ul><p>CNIL also recommends obtaining prior consent by ticking a designated checkbox on the registration form. The use of a pre-checked box is prohibited by the law.</p><div name="3.3.Exceptions" data-unique="3.3.Exceptions"></div><h3>3.3.

Moreover, organisations must ensure to collect the data subjects' consent if the data subjects who made their data public did not reasonably expect to be the subject of marketing by another company. The mere acceptance by an internet user, in a general and non-specific manner, of the terms of use of a service cannot be regarded as a specific consent, even if these terms of use inform the user that they may receive marketing materials by physical or electronic means (the Repurposing Data Guidance).</p><p>The collected data must not excess the minimal requirements, especially concerning special categories of data.</p><p>Organisations transmitting the data must collect this consent, on behalf of the recipients, at the time of the initial collection of the data. To do so, individuals must be informed of the identity of the data controller partners who would use their data for marketing purposes, through an exhaustive list made available directly on or from the collection medium (e.g., by including a hyperlink), as well as the specific purpose of the transmission (the Referential).</p><p>Otherwise, the recipients of the data must collect consent themselves by soliciting the data subjects, which constitutes a processing of personal data operation which must be based on the recipient's documented legitimate interest, and cannot itself be considered as a commercial proposition (the Referential).</p><p>Organisations are required to inform in a clear and plain way, at the latest upon the first contact with the data subjects, with all information provided in Article 14 of the GDPR, and namely on the purposes of the processing and the source of the data (the Referential).</p><p>The rental or sale of lists containing telephone data and including contact details of one or more consumers registered in the Bloctel is prohibited (Article L223-3 of the Consumer Code).</p><div name="5.NationalOpt-OutList" data-unique="5.NationalOpt-OutList"></div><h2><a id="column-5" name="column-5"></a>5.
