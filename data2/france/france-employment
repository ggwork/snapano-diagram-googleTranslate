The employees were granted damages.</p><p>Employers should be cautious in submitting evidence in court containing personal data of employees other than that of the opposing party; where possible, personal data should be redacted.</p><div name="2.RECRUITMENTANDSELECTION" data-unique="2.RECRUITMENTANDSELECTION"></div><h2>2.

General requirements for collection, processing, and disclosure of data</h3><p>Although recruitment or selection may well be an opportunity to collect a large amount of personal data, not all processing of personal data is permitted in the employment or recruitment context.</p><div name="2.1.1.Legalbasisandtypeofdatathatcanbecollected,processedanddisclosed" data-unique="2.1.1.Legalbasisandtypeofdatathatcanbecollected,processedanddisclosed"></div><h3>2.1.1. Legal basis and type of data that can be collected, processed and disclosed</h3><p>Employers must determine and document the legal basis on which they rely for processing personal data. This legal basis is closely linked to the employer's purpose for processing data.</p><p>There are six lawful grounds for processing pursuant to Article 6 of the GDPR:</p><ol><li>consent;</li><li>performance of a contract (or pre-contractual measure);</li><li>compliance with a legal obligation;</li><li>legitimate interests;</li><li>protection of a person's vital interests; and</li><li>performance of a task carried out in the public interest.</li></ol><p>The first four legal bases are likely to concern the employer's processing of employee data. However, bearing in mind that consent is generally considered as not freely given in the employee/employer context in light of the subordinate relationship, it should generally not be relied upon in this context. This was affirmed, on 27 July 2019, in a decision (only available in Greek <a href="http://www.dpa.gr/APDPXPortlets/htdocs/documentSDisplay.jsp?docid=175,223,91,0,152,132,151,16" target="_blank">here</a>) ('the Decision') by the <a href="https://www.dpa.gr/portal/page?_pageid=33,40911&amp;_dad=portal&amp;_schema=PORTAL" target="_blank">Hellenic Data Protection Authority</a> ('HDPA'), which fined a company €150,000 for requiring its employees to provide consent to the processing of their personal data. The Decision underlined that the 'consent of data subjects in the context of employment relations cannot be regarded as freely given due to the clear imbalance between the parties.' This is consistent with the <a href="https://platform.dataguidance.com/legal-research/article-29-working-party-guidelines-consent-under-regulation-2016679-10-april-2018" target="_blank">Article 29 Working Party's Guidelines on Consent Under Regulation 2016/679</a>. In the employment context, consent should only be relied upon in limited cases, such as for the use of an employee's birthday for display on the company intranet, the use of an employee's food preferences, taping a promotional video in the workplace showing identifiable employees, situations in which the employee's refusal to give consent or to withdraw consent will have no impact on his work conditions or relationship.</p><p>For recruitment, consent may be sought as the parties are not yet in an employment relationship. Note though that the refusal to give consent should not affect the candidate's chance to obtain the job. It is thus advisable to rely on legitimate interests and pre-contractual measures, if possible, also to avoid having to deal with the potential issue of the withdrawal of consent.</p><p>Specific rules apply for processing special categories of data such as personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, genetic data, biometric data identifying a natural person, data concerning health, data concerning a natural person's sex life or sexual orientation (commonly referred to as sensitive data). Processing of such sensitive data is generally prohibited, pursuant to Article 9(1) of the GDPR, except under certain exceptions listed in Article 9(2), some of which may apply or concern the processing of employee data, namely if:</p><ul><li>the processing is necessary, and the person concerned has given his or her valid express consent (as indicated above, we would not recommend relying on consent);</li><li>the processing is necessary to carry out obligations and exercise rights of the employer or employee in the field of employment and social security and social protection law if provided by French law;</li><li>the information is made public by the person concerned;</li><li>it is necessary for the safety of human life;</li><li>it is necessary for the purposes of preventive or occupational medicine, for the assessment of the working capacity of the employee, medical diagnosis, the provision of health or social care or treatment or the management of health or social care systems and services; or</li><li>it is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.</li></ul><p>With the COVID-19 pandemic, CNIL has had to remind employers about the rules applicable to the collection and processing of health data, setting out certain exceptions. Apart from the medical notices on working capacity from the occupational health services, limited information about virus contamination (name of employee and date of contamination) can be collected and processed by employers for the sole purpose of having to adapt work conditions and ensure safety in the workplace whilst protecting the health and safety of employees pursuant to Article L. 4121-1 of the Labour Code. No traces of the temperature of employees should be kept in paper or electronic format. Employers should work with occupational health services to put into place preventive measures and delegate any assessment as to state of health to such services. Employers may further check employees' sanitary passes (showing their vaccination status or a negative COVID-19 test) if the company premises are subject to such obligations and the employees work in spaces accessible to the public.</p><div name="2.1.2.Processingrules,disclosuresandrecords" data-unique="2.1.2.Processingrules,disclosuresandrecords"></div><h3>2.1.2. Processing rules, disclosures and records</h3><p>When processing the personal data of employees, employers must comply with the data protection principles set out under Article 5 of the GDPR (see section 3.1. below).</p><p><strong>Privacy notices</strong></p><p>The employer must provide the candidate/employee with the information regarding the collected data specified in Article 13 of the GDPR (or Article 14 of the GDPR if the information is not collected directly from the candidate or employee) and Articles 104 et seq. of the Act, namely:</p><ul><li>the identity and contact details of the employer and those of their representative, where applicable;</li><li>the name of the data protection officer ('DPO') if applicable;</li><li>the purposes and legal basis for which the data is processed;</li><li>the right to lodge a complaint with CNIL and its contact details;</li><li>the existence of the right to request from the data employer access to and rectification or erasure of personal data and restriction of processing of the personal data concerning the data subject;</li><li>the recipients or categories of recipients;</li><li>whether the data is transferred outside the EEA, and, if so, the protection measures that have been applied;</li><li>the period of data retention;</li><li>the employee's rights vis-à-vis the data; and</li><li>whether the employer uses automated decision-making.</li></ul><p>This information must be provided at the time the personal data is collected. We recommend providing such information in a separate privacy notice hand-remitted or posted in company premises or online on the company intranet, rather than in the employment agreement, to avoid having to amend the employment agreement each time there are changes to the data collection and processing.</p><p><strong>Records or register</strong></p><p>Companies with more than 250 employees must maintain records of their processing activities, in accordance with Article 30(5) of the GDPR (transposed into Article 100 of the Act), setting out how, why, to whom, and where the data is processed, and if there are any transfers of data and applicable security measures. CNIL has provided a draft register on its website for these purposes (only available to download in French <a href="https://www.cnil.fr/sites/default/files/atoms/files/registre-traitement-simplifie.ods" target="_blank">here</a>). Companies with less than 250 employees are also required to maintain such records. However, such companies only have to register processing activities when such activities:</p><ul><li>are carried out regularly (e.g. payroll management, and client and vendor management);</li><li>are likely to pose a high risk to the rights and freedoms or employees (e.g. geolocation monitoring and CCTV); or</li><li>involve sensitive data.</li></ul><p><strong>Automated decision-making</strong></p><p>Employers may not use automated decision-making if the decisions significantly impact employees, unless an exception applies. In the employment context, automated decision-making is sometimes used during recruitment to filter out certain applicants. If so, the employer will also need to rely on one of the exceptions listed below and implement measures to protect the applicant's rights and freedoms and legitimate interests, by explaining what is being done, and providing for safeguards, ensuring the right to intervene in the processing, and the right to express an opinion and contest the decision. Exceptions apply where the decision is necessary to enter into or execute the employment agreement, where it is based on the individual's explicit consent, or if it is provided by law, provided that the person's rights, freedoms, and legitimate interests are also protected by law.</p><div name="2.2.AdvertisingapositionandrequirementsfordatacollectionregardingCVs,tests,evaluations" data-unique="2.2.AdvertisingapositionandrequirementsfordatacollectionregardingCVs,tests,evaluations"></div><h3><a id="column-2" name="column-2"></a>2.2. Advertising a position and requirements for data collection regarding CVs, tests, evaluations</h3><p>Employers that advertise available positions and receive offers from candidates will be collecting personal data, in particular through collecting CVs. They will need to disclose information regarding such collection and processing, in particular, the legal basis (e.g. pre-contractual measures) and information listed in Article 13 and 14 of the GDPR. Such information may be disclosed online with a link to a privacy policy.</p><p>The information requested must enable the evaluation of a candidate's professional skills and capacity to occupy the position, and have a direct link with the position advertised, or with the evaluation of professional skills.</p><p>With respect to means used to assist recruitment (e.g. automatic data processing), Articles L. 1221-8 and 9 of the Labour Code (only available in French <a href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCode.do;jsessionid=330AF057A539DF2FC1901B1DFCE4B4A5.tplgfr43s_1?idSectionTA=LEGISCTA000006189415&amp;cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006072050&amp;dateTexte=20191016" target="_blank">here</a>) provide that:</p><ul><li>the candidate must be expressly informed of the recruitment methods and techniques used;</li><li>data may not be collected by methods of which the candidate has not been made aware;</li><li>such methods and techniques must be appropriate for the purpose of their use; and</li><li>the results must be kept confidential.</li></ul><p>If specific tests and/or evaluations are carried out by an external service provider or personal data obtained from such third party, employers should ensure that such data is obtained fairly and in compliance with applicable law.</p><div name="2.3.Requirementsandrestrictionsinrelationtobackgroundchecks" data-unique="2.3.Requirementsandrestrictionsinrelationtobackgroundchecks"></div><h3><a id="column-3" name="column-3"></a>2.3. Requirements and restrictions in relation to background checks</h3><p>In France, background checks aimed at obtaining personal data related to offences, convictions or security measures are only permissible under certain conditions, namely for certain types of activity (e.g. surveillance and/or security companies, transportation of funds, casinos, bank) and if the background check has a direct and necessary link with the proposed job.</p><p>Copies of criminal records in France may only be requested by the data subject and not by third parties (i.e. the employer). The data subject&nbsp;can apply for a certificate showing their criminal record online.</p><p>Once obtained, it is advisable not to keep the certificate in the employee file but to send it back to the data subject, as such information should not be saved or kept by the employer. Employers are not listed as the persons able to process data relating to criminal convictions and offenses, pursuant to Article 46 of the Act. Potential sanctions for saving or keeping private criminal records are five years' imprisonment and a fine of €300,000 for individuals, and €1,500,000 for legal persons, pursuant to Articles 226-19 § 2 and 131-38 of the Penal Code. Employer files should, therefore, only specify whether criminal records have been checked or not, without any further information.</p><div name="2.4.Obligationsoftheemployertoprotectcandidates'righttoprivacyduringinterviewprocess" data-unique="2.4.Obligationsoftheemployertoprotectcandidates'righttoprivacyduringinterviewprocess"></div><h3>2.4. Obligations of the employer to protect candidates' right to privacy during interview process</h3><p>Information collected during the interview process would be considered as personal data and protected as such under the GDPR and the Act. The employer must comply with the GDPR and disclose information to the candidate regarding the information collected, as well as with the rules applicable to data processing, in particular as regards data minimisation (i.e. only data that is adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the selection of the candidate may be kept), and storage limitation (i.e. the data should not be kept for longer than is necessary).</p><div name="2.5.Employer'srighttoaskquestions/requestreferences" data-unique="2.5.Employer'srighttoaskquestions/requestreferences"></div><h3>2.5. Employer's right to ask questions/request references</h3><p>According to Article L. 1221-6 of the Labour Code, the information requested from candidates may only be used to assess their ability to hold the proposed job or their professional skills. It must have a direct and necessary link with the job offered or with the assessment of professional skills. It is therefore prohibited to ask a candidate for his/her social security number, information on his/her family, political opinions, or trade union membership. Such information may only be collected pursuant to the application of one of the legal bases provided by Article 6 of the GDPR.</p><p>In addition, the employer must ensure not to discriminate against the candidate during the selection process on account of personal information relating to his/her origin, sex, morality, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, family status or pregnancy, genetic characteristics, particular vulnerabilities resulting from the candidate's economic situation, apparent or known, ethnicity, nationality or race, political opinions, trade union or mutual benefit organisations, religious beliefs, physical appearance, family name, place of residence or bank domiciliation, state of health, loss of autonomy or disability (Article L. 1132-1 of the Labour Code). Such data should, therefore, not be collected during the selection process.</p><div name="2.6.Candidate'sobligationtorevealinformation" data-unique="2.6.Candidate'sobligationtorevealinformation"></div><h3>2.6. Candidate's obligation to reveal information</h3><p>Article L. 1221-6 of the Labour Code provides that the candidate must answer the employer's information requests in good faith. Thus, the candidate should not refuse to reveal any pertinent information request which is linked to the offered job, failing which his or her candidacy may be rejected. The privacy policy should specify if certain information is required and that the failure to provide such data may impact the candidate's application negatively.</p><div name="2.7.Retentionofrecruitmentrecords" data-unique="2.7.Retentionofrecruitmentrecords"></div><h3><a id="column-4" name="column-4"></a>2.7. Retention of recruitment records</h3><p>In accordance with Article 5 of the GDPR and Article 4 of the Act, personal data may be kept for no longer than is necessary for the purpose for which the data is processed (e.g. the duration of the selection process).</p><p>If the application is successful, then the personal data may be kept for the purpose of managing the candidate's employment during the period of employment and for a defined period thereafter (e.g. five years after termination). This should be disclosed to the employee.</p><p>If the application is rejected, the recruiter must inform the applicant that their file will be kept, thus giving them the opportunity to request its deletion. If no such request is made, CNIL considers that records may be kept up until two years after the last contact with the applicant, unless he/she has given express consent to such storage. This should be disclosed in the privacy policy.</p><div name="2.8.Informationtobeprovidedwhenactingasareferee" data-unique="2.8.Informationtobeprovidedwhenactingasareferee"></div><h3>2.8. Information to be provided when acting as a referee</h3><p>While the use of references is common in recruitment processes, there are no legal obligations imposing the provision of such references. Therefore, no specific rules apply, nor does a formalised procedure exist. In France, employers only tend to grant the former employee's employment dates and position,&nbsp;information set out on employee's work certificate remitted upon termination.</p><p>In any event, former employers should not provide information that could be detrimental to a former employee. We would recommend even that the employer check with the former employee if he/she wishes them to provide a reference.</p><p>If an employer maintains certain personal data post-termination solely to provide references, they&nbsp;must obtain the former employee's consent and should not retain any data if consent is withheld or withdrawn.</p><p>Please note that conditions related to references are sometimes negotiated and dealt with in post-termination settlement agreements.</p><div name="3.EMPLOYMENTRECORDS" data-unique="3.EMPLOYMENTRECORDS"></div><h2>3.

General requirements for collection, processing and disclosure of data</h3><p>Article 5 of the GDPR sets out the general requirements for processing personal data in employment records.</p><p><strong>Lawfulness, fairness and transparency</strong></p><p>The processing of employees' data must be lawful, fair and transparent. Employers must identify a lawful basis for processing each category of data and provide such information to the employee in a privacy notice, for example.</p><p><strong>Purpose limitation</strong></p><p>Employees' data must be collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes, and must not be processed in a manner that is incompatible with such purposes. Such purposes need to be disclosed to the employee, and the employer must also be able to prove that it has only collected and processed the data for the specified disclosed purpose. The employer must further not reuse the data for other purposes, unless such use is legally justified.</p><p><strong>Data minimisation</strong></p><p>Collected employee data must always be adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed. Employers should not process irrelevant, excessive or unnecessary data. This principle is particularly important in the employment context.</p><p><strong>Accuracy</strong></p><p>Employee data shall be accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date. In order to maintain accurate data, employers may request that employees inform them of any changes in their personal data (e.g<em>.</em> change in personal address).</p><p><strong>Storage limitation</strong></p><p>Employee data should be kept in a form which permits the identification of employees for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data is processed. This means that employers should regularly examine the data held and determine whether certain data must be eliminated depending on the purpose for which it is processed.</p><p><strong>Integrity and confidentiality</strong></p><p>Employee data should be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage. The employer needs to check it has appropriate technical or organisational measures to protect the data, which may need to be updated or reassessed in particular in the event of data incidents or breaches.</p><p><strong>Accountability</strong></p><p>The data controller is responsible for, and must be able to demonstrate compliance with these principles. This entails keeping accurate records of the processing activity, reviewing and updating privacy policies, training employees on the protection of personal data, and notifying data breaches, where necessary.</p><p><strong>Collection, processing and storage of special category data</strong></p><p>See section 2.1.1. above.</p><div name="3.2.Notificationtotheemployeeoncollection,processing,accessanddisclosure" data-unique="3.2.Notificationtotheemployeeoncollection,processing,accessanddisclosure"></div><h3><a id="column-6" name="column-6"></a>3.2. Notification to the employee on collection, processing, access and disclosure</h3><p>Employers must notify employees on the personal data they collect and process about them and on their rights as regards such data.</p><p>The following information must be provided (Articles 13 and 14 of the GDPR):</p><ul><li>the name and contact details of the data controller (employer);</li><li>the contact details of the DPO, if applicable;</li><li>the purposes for which personal data are processed;</li><li>the legal basis for processing;</li><li>if data is obtained from third parties, the categories of personal data;</li><li>the recipients or categories of recipients of the personal data, if any;</li><li>the legitimate interests of the employer, if processing is based on such legitimate interests;</li><li>the recipients or categories of recipients of the personal data, if any;</li><li>where applicable, the fact that the employer intends to transfer personal data outside the EEA, the existence of an adequacy decision or in the absence of such decision, the protective measures implemented (e.g<em>.</em> Standard Contractual Clauses ('SCCs')) and how to obtain information about them;</li><li>the period during which the personal data will be stored, or if that is not possible, the criteria used to determine this period;</li><li>the rights of the data subject:<ul><li>to request access to and rectification or erasure of personal data or restriction of processing;</li><li>to object to processing;</li><li>to data portability;</li><li>to withdraw consent (if appropriate); and</li><li>to lodge a complaint with CNIL;</li></ul></li><li>if data is collected from the employee, whether the provision of personal data is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement to enter into the contract;</li><li>if data is collected from the employee, whether the employee must provide the personal data and of the possible consequences of failure to provide such data;</li><li>the existence of automated decision-making (if any), including information about how decisions are made and their significance and consequences; and</li><li>in relation to data obtained from third parties, from which source the personal data originated, and if applicable, whether it came from publicly accessible sources.</li></ul><p>Such information should be provided in a concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible format using clear and plain language. Usually, it is provided in a privacy notice.</p><p>Firstly, employers must ensure that the information is understandable. Clear, precise and simple language should be used, as well as short sentences and direct style. Abstract or ambiguous terms should not be used be (e.g. 'we may use your data'; 'a possible use of your data'; 'some data about you is used').</p><p>Secondly, employers must provide concise information, using effective and succinct presentation, and short, readable text, adapted to the specific circumstances. Employers can use the format of a Q&amp;A to provide the information in a more comprehensive way.</p><p>Thirdly, the information should be accessible and easy to find (in digital or paper format), clearly distinguishable from other clauses or information, using, for example, context-specific methods as suggested by CNIL (e.g. QR code, audio message, video, billboards, paper documentation, information campaign, pop-up windows). CNIL provides certain recommendations in an online guide (only available in French <a href="https://www.cnil.fr/en/node/24281" target="_blank">here</a>). It recommends, in particular, emphasising the identity of the data controller, the purposes of the processing, and the employee rights regarding such data.</p><div name="3.3.Retentionofemploymentrecords" data-unique="3.3.Retentionofemploymentrecords"></div><h3><a id="column-7" name="column-7"></a>3.3. Retention of employment records</h3><p>Once the information has been collected by the employer, it generally is kept for a certain period of time, usually during the duration of the employment relationship. Article 5 of the GDPR provides that data should not be kept for longer than is necessary, in relation to the purposes for which it is processed (data minimisation). Employers must, therefore, determine appropriate retention periods for each category of employee data that is processed, taking into account business needs, and the applicable statute of limitations, and provide for such periods, usually in data retention policies. It is also possible to archive and keep certain data separate from the active data base granting limited or restricted access to certain persons.</p><p>Keeping certain types of data after termination may be required for purposes such as enabling the employer to defend itself against employee claims. Certain emails pertaining to ongoing business contracts may also need to be kept until at least the termination of the contract. Purposes relating to tax may further justify keeping personal data beyond the termination of employment. Moreover, employers may determine that employee payslips should be kept up until the employee's retirement age, as, in practice, former employees often request payslips to prove their retirement entitlements.</p><div name="3.4.Employeerightstoinformation" data-unique="3.4.Employeerightstoinformation"></div><h3>3.4. Employee rights to information</h3><p>In addition to the right to be informed of the processing of personal data at the time of collection, the data subject benefits from certain information and access rights.</p><p><strong>Access rights</strong></p><p>An employee making a subject access request ('SAR') has the right:</p><ul><li>to be informed whether the employer is processing information about them;</li><li>if so, to be given a copy of their employee information, together with various details, including why the employer is processing the information, the types of information, the recipients to whom the information has or will be disclosed (including internationally), how long the information will be stored, the source of the information, and details of any automated decision-making;</li><li>to be informed of their rights to ask to rectify, erase or restrict the employer's use of the employee information, and the right to complain to CNIL; and</li><li>to be informed of where information is transferred outside the EEA, and details on any safeguards regarding the overseas transfer.</li></ul><p>Complying with a SAR can involve a lot of work and a significant cost, as employee information, by its nature, may not be held in a clearly structured way. Accordingly, when searching for such data, the employer must search for manual records, in addition to all electronic records, emails, documents. For example, an employee could ask for details of email discussions that others in the organisation have had about them over a long time period, which could require extensive searches of various email accounts. An employer cannot normally refuse to provide such information, unless an exception applies. A common exception in this context is where disclosing the information adversely affects the rights and freedoms of others, such as in cases where the information also contains details about another employee. In certain cases, the names of other employees or persons would thus need to be redacted. The employee is entitled to obtain a copy of the personal data processed free of charge (additional copies may be charged a reasonable fee based on administrative costs).</p><p>The employer must comply with the request without undue delay, and in any event within one month. Where the request is complex, such as when it requires searching substantial quantities of information across many different systems, the employer can extend the deadline by a further two months and would need to inform the employee of such extension within one month of receipt of the request.</p><p>If the employee makes the request electronically, the employer should provide the information in a commonly used electronic portable format. However, the employee can ask for it to be provided in an alternative format, such as paper copies.</p><p><strong>Right to rectification</strong></p><p>If the employee's data is inaccurate, he/she may request rectification of their data without undue delay. If the data is incomplete, the employee may request that it be completed.</p><p><strong>Right to erasure (right to be forgotten)</strong></p><p>An employee may request to have their personal data erased without undue delay if the data is no longer necessary or the data is unlawfully processed. Otherwise, if the employer does not rely on consent to process data and has carried out legitimate interest assessments, employees are unlikely to be able to have their data erased.</p><p><strong>Right of restriction of processing</strong></p><p>The restriction of processing can only be obtained in the following rare circumstances:</p><ul><li>if the accuracy of the data is contested;</li><li>if the processing is unlawful; and</li><li>if the employer no longer needs the data but the employee still needs it in order to establish, exercise, or defend a legal claim.</li></ul><p><strong>Right to data portability</strong></p><p>The data subject's right to receive personal data in a structured commonly used and machine-readable format under certain circumstances and transmit this data to another controller is mostly not relevant in the employment context as it only concerns data processed based on consent or a contract, but not data processed to comply with a legal obligation or legitimate interest so that it would not likely apply. If applicable, we would recommend specifying what data may give rise to portability.</p><p><strong>Right to object to the processing of personal data</strong></p><p>An employee may object to data processing if the employer relied either on the performance of a task carried out in the public interest, which is unlikely to be realised, or on its legitimate interests, except if these interests override the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the employee, or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.</p><p><strong>Automated decision–making and profiling</strong></p><p>Employers may not use automated decision-making if the decisions significantly impact employees, unless an exception applies. Provided exceptions include:</p><ul><li>where use of automated decision-making is necessary to enter into or execute the employment agreement;</li><li>where use of automated decision-making is based on the employee's explicit consent; and</li><li>where use of automated decision-making is provided by law, provided that the employee's rights, freedoms and legitimate interests are also protected by law.</li></ul><p>In the employment context, automated decision-making is not recommended, although it is sometimes used during recruitment to filter out certain applicants. If so, the employer will also need to rely on one of the exceptions referred to above and implement measures to protect the applicant's rights and freedoms and legitimate interests, by explaining what is being done and providing for safeguards with the right to obtain human intervention in the processing, the right to express his or her opinion and to contest the decision.</p><div name="3.5.Disclosuretoworkscouncils,stateauthorities,arbitrationcourts,etc." data-unique="3.5.Disclosuretoworkscouncils,stateauthorities,arbitrationcourts,etc."></div><h3>3.5. Disclosure to works councils, state authorities, arbitration courts, etc.</h3><p><strong>Disclosure to work councils</strong></p><p>Social and economic committees ('CSEs'), new French works council body, may require access to employee data to carry out their functions. With respect to companies with more than 50 employees, the CSE is permitted access to a database containing all the information necessary for its recurrent research and consultation (e.g. indicators necessary to calculate a possible gender pay gap). This information would normally be provided without any identifiable personal data, as names redacted and data thus anonymised.</p><p>However, the CSE also manages cultural and social activities and has a specific budget for such purposes. In order to manage such activities, it requires access to certain personal data concerning employees, such as the names of the employees, and information relating to their families such as the number of children they have and their age. The employer, therefore, needs to inform the employees that it will be transferring certain aspects of their personal data to the CSE in order for it to manage the social and cultural activities, stating what type of data it will be transferring. Employees should receive the information listed in Article 13 of the GDPR, which may have not been included in the privacy notice. The employer may rely on the legitimate interest purpose and not seek the employees' consent. However, employees would then have a right to object to such transfer. If the employees do object, then the CSE would need to obtain the information from the employee directly. Any employee who has objected would be entitled to such social and cultural activities, provided he/she has sent the required data to the CSE.</p><p>The CSE would be bound by confidentiality obligations as regards such personal data. It is recommended that the employer clearly indicates to the CSE that this data is confidential, and strictly limit the uses the CSE can make of such data. It should be noted that CNIL, prior to the enactment of GDPR, adopted an exemption decision ('the Exemption Decision') in Deliberation No. 2006/230 of 17 October 2006 (only available in French <a href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCnil.do?id=CNILTEXT000017651773" target="_blank">here</a>), as regards the management of such cultural and social activities. The Exemption Decision sets out a number of obligations that apply to such data processing, such as the type of data that can be transferred and the retention period for such data (two years maximum with respect to any data relating to services provided to the employee), as well as security and confidentiality obligations. The principles of the Exemption Decision still apply.</p><p><strong>State authorities</strong></p><p>Article 23 of the GDPR provides that data subject rights may be restricted by law under certain specific circumstances (e.g. national security, defence, public security, prevention, investigation or prosecution of criminal offenses, objectives of general public interest, and judicial proceedings). Articles 115 et seq. of the Act provide for such restrictions for processing related to State defence and security.</p><div name="4.INFORMATIONABOUTWORKERS'HEALTH" data-unique="4.INFORMATIONABOUTWORKERS'HEALTH"></div><h2><a id="column-8" name="column-8"></a><a id="column-9" name="column-9"></a>4.

General rules on processing of workers' health information and exceptions</h3><p>Data concerning health is defined by Article 4(15) of the GDPR as 'personal data related to the physical or mental health of a natural person, including the provision of health care services, which reveal information about his/her health status.'</p><p>Processing of 'data concerning health' is prohibited under Article 9(1) of the GDPR, except under certain exceptions listed in Article 9(2). The exceptions which would be relevant in the employment context are:</p><ul><li>if the employee explicitly consented to the processing (although given the subordinate relationship, such consent would most likely not be considered as free by CNIL);</li><li>if the processing is necessary to enable the employer or employee to carry out their obligations and exercise their specific rights in the field of employment and social security and social protection law (insofar as this is permitted by EU or Member State law). This would be the case as regards information on work accidents and occupational sicknesses;</li><li>if the processing relates to data made public by the employee;</li><li>if the processing is necessary to establish, exercise or defend legal claims, or whenever courts are acting in their judicial capacity;</li><li>if the processing is necessary for reasons of substantial public interest; and</li><li>if the processing is necessary for the purposes of preventive or occupational medicine, for the assessment of the working capacity of the employee, medical diagnosis, the provision of health or social care or treatment or the management of health or social care systems and services, provided the data is processed by or under the responsibility of a professional, subject to the obligation of professional secrecy.</li></ul><p>It should be noted that the employees' medical records would be held by the occupational health service providers, not by the employer. The occupational health doctor bound by the medical professional secrecy obligation cannot disclose such records to the employer and can only communicate the records to another doctor, at the employee's request. The employer would not be entitled to ask for such information, except in the case of a work accident or occupational disease. The employer should only be provided with information which is necessary to determine if the employee is capable of carrying out their&nbsp;work.&nbsp;There have been exceptions as regards COVID-19 contamination information but such data collection is restricted (see in section 2.1.1 above).</p><div name="5.EMPLOYEEDATATRANSFERS" data-unique="5.EMPLOYEEDATATRANSFERS"></div><h2><a id="column-10" name="column-10"></a>5. EMPLOYEE DATA TRANSFERS</h2><div name="5.1.Legalgrounds" data-unique="5.1.Legalgrounds"></div><h3>5.1. Legal grounds</h3><p>Employers are required to have a legal basis for employee data transfers, in addition to an identified purpose. An example of such purposes could be group management of HR data, which would justify the need to transfer certain employee data to a parent company or to a service provider located outside the EEA. Data minimisation should be taken into account, so that not all employee data is transferred, but only data that is strictly required for the specified purpose.</p><div name="5.2.Mechanismsforthetransfersofdata" data-unique="5.2.Mechanismsforthetransfersofdata"></div><h3>5.2. Mechanisms for the transfers of data</h3><p>The mechanisms for transferring the data will depend on where the recipient of the data (data importer) is located. If it is outside the EEA, and not a country recognised as adequate by the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/index_en" target="_blank">European Commission</a> (such as Israel, Switzerland, Japan, Canada, New Zealand, Argentina), then the employer will need to put into place protective measures prior to the data transfer. Regarding the UK, following Brexit, the UK was declared an adequate country on June 28, 2021.</p><p>Recognised and approved protective mechanisms are:</p><ul><li>SCCs approved by the European Commission (new <a href="https://www.dataguidance.com/legal-research/commission-implementing-decision-eu-2021915-4" target="_blank">SCCs between controllers and processors</a> were adopted on 4 June 2021 which entered into force on 27 June &nbsp;2021). The former controller-to-controller and controller-to-processor SCCs can no longer be used as from 27 September 2021 will need to be replaced within a period of 18 months, therefore by 27 December 2022. The new clauses can be used for controller to controller, controller to processor, processor to processor and processor to controller transfers. In addition to entering into the SCCs, data exporters will need to carry out a transfer impact assessment, as well as an assessment as to the data importer country assessment.</li><li>Binding Corporate Rules ('BCRs'), adopted at the level of a group of companies.</li></ul><div name="5.3.Sensitivedata" data-unique="5.3.Sensitivedata"></div><h3>5.3.

In the employment context, CNIL has recommended that DPIAs be carried out where employers carry out profiling of their employees (for example, of high profiles, to recruit or evaluate employees) or constant surveillance of certain employees (e.g. employees manipulating funds or in warehouses, truck drivers) or have implemented whistleblowing schemes.</p><div name="6.SANCTIONS" data-unique="6.SANCTIONS"></div><h2><a id="column-11" name="column-11"></a>6.

Criminal and civil liabilities&nbsp;</h3><p>CNIL has numerous enforcement powers (e.g. a formal notice, an injunction to comply, the withdrawal of a certification, the partial or total suspension of the decision to approve BCRs), pursuant to Article 58 of the GDPR and Article 20 of the Act.</p><p>Pursuant to Article 83 of the GDPR (as implemented in Article 20 of the Act), administrative fines imposed for non-compliance with the GDPR can reach up to €20 million or 4% of the previous year's total worldwide annual turnover, whichever is higher.</p><p>CNIL will take into account the following criteria listed by Article 83 of the GDPR, to assess the amount of the fine:</p><ul><li>the nature, gravity and duration of the infringement (taking into account the purpose of the processing, the number of data subjects affected, and the level of damage suffered);</li><li>the intentional or negligent character of the infringement;</li><li>the actions taken (or not) to mitigate the damage;</li><li>technical and organisational measures implemented;</li><li>any relevant previous infringements by the data controller or data processor;</li><li>the degree of cooperation with CNIL;</li><li>the categories of personal data affected by the infringement;</li><li>how the infringement became known to the supervisory authority;</li><li>if measures of Article 58(2) of the GDPR have previously been ordered against the data controller;</li><li>adherence to approved codes of conduct or approved certification mechanisms; and</li><li>any other aggravating or mitigating factor (e.g. financial benefits or losses arising from the infringement).</li></ul><p>In addition to the administrative fines provided by the GDPR, the Penal Code provides for fines and even imprisonment for failure to comply with certain obligations. Pursuant to Article 226-16 et seq. of the Penal Code, the fact, including through negligence, of processing, collecting or storing personal data (or having them processed) without compliance with the formalities required by the provisions of French law is punishable by imprisonment for a term of up to five years and a fine of up to €300,000.</p></div></div></div>
