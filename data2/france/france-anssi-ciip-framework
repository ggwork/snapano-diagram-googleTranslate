Issuing body</h3><p>Decree No. 2009-834 of 7 July 2009 (only available in French <a href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000020828212" target="_blank">here</a>) replaced the Central Directorate for Network and Information Security ('DCSSI') of the <a href="http://www.sgdsn.gouv.fr/" target="_blank">Secretariat General for Defence and National Security</a> ('SGDSN') with the <a href="https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/" target="_blank">National Cybersecurity Agency of France</a> ('ANSSI'). ANSSI acts as the national authority for cybersecurity and network and information security in France.</p><p>ANSSI is highly active and also works on an international level with, for instance, cybersecurity authorities, the <a href="https://www.cert.ssi.gouv.fr/" target="_blank">Computer Emergency Response Team</a> ('CERT-FR'), and the <a href="https://www.defense.gouv.fr/" target="_blank">Ministry of Defence</a>, to promote and engage in discussions of French positions on cybersecurity policies.</p><p>France does not have one single over-arching cybersecurity framework. Requirements are dispersed across different sector- or subject-specific frameworks. In terms of critical information systems, France became the first country to pass legislation implementing an efficient and obligatory system to ensure the cybersecurity of critical infrastructures.</p><p>This Guidance Note provides an overview of the <a href="https://www.dataguidance.com/legal-research/anssi-french-ciip-framework" target="_blank">French regulatory framework for Critical Infrastructures Information Protection</a> ('the CIIP Framework'), and in particular on the requirements of Article 22 of the Military Planning Law No. 2013-1168 of 18 December 2013 (only available in French <a href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000028338825&amp;categorieLien=id" target="_blank">here</a>) ('the Military Planning Law').</p><div name="1.2.Foundationsandpurpose" data-unique="1.2.Foundationsandpurpose"></div><h3>1.2. Foundations and purpose</h3><p>The CIIP Framework consists of the multi-lateral interactions between ANSSI, cybersecurity service providers, critical operators/ operators of essential services ('OES'),&nbsp;and sectoral ministries. OES are required to inform ANSSI of their status of compliance and report back to ANSSI where required, for instance with security incident notifications. In return, ANSSI supports and controls the OES. Any communication between ANSSI and OES regarding the critical information systems are strictly confidential. Furthermore, ANSSI qualifies trust service providers who can then offer services to OES to aid in the functioning of their critical information systems. ANSSI and OES will also cooperate with sectoral ministries and regulators where necessary.</p><p>Requirements for OES to ensure the security of their critical information system are included in the following documents and legislation.</p><p><strong>Pre-Military Planning Law</strong></p><p>The Order of 2 June 2006 Establishing the List of the Sectors of Critical Infrastructure and Designating Coordinating Ministers of these Sectors (only available in French <a href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000423259&amp;categorieLien=id" target="_blank">here</a>) ('the Order') identified key sectors of vital importance for the functioning of the country, such as the health, finance, and communication sectors.</p><p>In 2011, ANSSI adopted a strategy for information systems defence and security (only available in French <a href="https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/uploads/2015/10/strategie_nationale_securite_numerique_fr.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>), with one of its key priorities being the strengthening of the cybersecurity of critical national infrastructure.</p><p>In 2013, the Government of France's <a href="https://www.dataguidance.com/legal-research/french-whitepaper-defence-and-national-security-2013" target="_blank">Whitepaper on Defence and National Security</a> ('the Whitepaper') identified cyberattacks as one of the largest risks faced by critical infrastructures.</p><p><strong>Military Planning Law</strong></p><p>In response to the Whitepaper, the Government promulgated, on 18 December 2013, the Military Planning Law. In particular, Article 22 of the Military Planning Law requires OES to ensure the protection and security of their critical information systems.</p><p>In November 2014, ANSSI set up working groups with voluntary public and private operators to co-draft further sector-specific provisions, which came into effect gradually between 2016 and 2019. Following these discussions, ANSSI developed a typology of critical information systems, a set of cross-sectoral security rules ('the Security Rules'), and a framework for security incidents.</p><p>On 27 March 2015, two decrees were issued to enact the Military Planning Act. Decree No. 2015-351 of 27 March 2015 on the security of critical information systems (only available in French <a href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000030405967" target="_blank">here</a>) and Decree No. 2015-350 of 27 March 2015 on the qualification of trust services providers and products for the security of information systems (only available in French <a href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000030405903" target="_blank">here</a>) both expand upon the Military Planning Law with provisions for ensuring the security of critical information systems.</p><p>Most recently, the <a href="https://platform.dataguidance.com/legal-research/directive-security-network-and-information-systems-directive-eu-20161148-nis" target="_blank">Directive on Security Network and Information Systems (Directive (EU) 2016/1148) </a>('the NIS Directive') covers European requirements for operators of essential services. The NIS Directive is transposed into French law by Act No. 2018-133 of 26 February 2018 laying down Various Provisions for Adaptation of European Union Law in the field of Security (only available in French <a href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do;jsessionid=65B8BE277709BD74DF2E90B841C184A2.tplgfr36s_3?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000036644772&amp;dateTexte=20200227" target="_blank">here</a>) and Decree 2018-384 of 23 May 2018 on the Security of Network and Information Systems of Operators of Essential Services and Digital Service Providers (only available in French <a href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000036939971&amp;dateTexte=&amp;oldAction=rechJO&amp;categorieLien=id&amp;idJO=JORFCONT000036939966#JORFSCTA000036939983" target="_blank" class="toc-filter-processed">here</a>).</p><div name="1.3.Compliancebenefits" data-unique="1.3.Compliancebenefits"></div><h3>1.3. Compliance benefits</h3><p>In general, the CIIP Framework requires OES to consider the privacy of their critical information systems, which may impact the functioning of the country should they suffer an attack or security incident.</p><p>Although the CIIP Framework must be respected by OES of critical information systems, the principles can also be applied independently of any regulatory framework in the interest of adopting best practices.</p><p><strong>Qualified Trust Service Providers</strong></p><p>ANSSI established a process for evaluating the qualification of providers who guarantee skilled and trustworthy services. Service providers and products from four specific fields can be qualified as 'Qualified Trust Service Providers' and ANSSI aims to cover the entirety of the cybersecurity lifecycle. These fields start with cybersecurity audit service providers with the role of assessing and checking critical information systems, followed by incident detection service providers and incident response service providers, and leading to integration/architecture service providers with the responsibility of building and rebuilding affecting critical information systems.</p><p>ANSSI provides standards containing specific requirements for audit service providers for information system security (only available in French <a href="https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/uploads/2014/12/PASSI_referentiel-exigences_v2.1.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>) ('the PASSI Standard'), <a href="https://www.dataguidance.com/legal-research/security-incident-detection-service-providers-requirements-reference-document-version" target="_blank">security incident detection service providers</a> ('the PDIS Standard'), and security incident response service providers (only available in French <a href="https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/uploads/2014/12/pris_referentiel_v2.0.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>) ('the PRIS Standard'). Compliance with these standards can be verified during the course of audit controls. When a service is required, ANSSI recommends using a Qualified Trust Service Provider as it guarantees compliance with the requirements of the relevant standards (the OES FAQs).</p><p>The full list of Qualified Trust Service Providers can be accessed <a href="https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/administration/qualifications/prestataires-de-services-de-confiance-qualifies/" target="_blank">here</a> and further information about ANSSI qualifications is available <a href="https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/entreprise/qualifications/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><p><strong>Non-compliance</strong></p><p>The Military Planning Law indicates that ANSSI, another government agency or qualified service providers ensure the application of the Security Rules through audits and are able to issue orders to non-compliant OES. Article L.1332-7 of the Code of Defence (only available in French <a href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do?cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006071307&amp;idArticle=LEGIARTI000028345141" target="_blank">here</a>) provides that sanctions of €150,000 may be issued to persons for failure to:</p><ul><li>establish an external protection policy for their critical information system in the given timeframe;</li><li>maintain a good level of security of the critical information system; and</li><li>comply with Article L.1332-6 of the Code of Defence.</li></ul><p>Article 131-38 of the Criminal Code (only available in French <a href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCode.do;jsessionid=48CDCC87C9A1B1F1C150B8CA8E37FAA1.tplgfr29s_3?cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006070719&amp;dateTexte=20200430" target="_blank">here</a>) indicates that legal persons can be issued with fines of up to €750,000 for the same infractions.</p><h4>1.4. Related legislation, frameworks, standards, and supplemental resources</h4><p>As part of its role within the CIIP Framework, ANSSI has issued guidance for OES which include the following:</p><ul><li>the Security Rules (only available in French <a href="https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/entreprise/protection-des-oiv/les-regles-de-securite/" target="_blank">here</a>) ('the Security Rules');</li><li><a href="https://www.dataguidance.com/legal-research/anssi-french-ciip-framework-faqs" target="_blank">FAQs</a>;</li><li>Frequently-Asked-Questions for operators of essential services (only available in French <a href="https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/entreprise/protection-des-oiv/foire-aux-questions/" target="_blank">here</a>) ('the OES FAQs');</li><li>Protection of OES (only available in French <a href="https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/entreprise/protection-des-oiv/protection-des-oiv-en-france/" target="_blank">here</a>);</li><li>Protection of Information Systems (only available in French <a href="https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/entreprise/reglementation/protection-des-systemes-dinformations/" target="_blank">here</a>);</li><li>Cybersecurity in Action (only available in French <a href="https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/entreprise/protection-des-oiv/la-cybersecurite-en-action/" target="_blank">here</a>);</li><li>Trust Service Providers (only available in French <a href="https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/entreprise/qualifications/prestataires-de-services-de-confiance-qualifies/" target="_blank">here</a>);</li><li>National Strategy for Digital Security (only available in French <a href="https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/uploads/2015/10/strategie_nationale_securite_numerique_fr.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>); and</li><li>Transposition of the NIS Directive in France (only available in French <a href="https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/en/actualite/transposition-of-the-nis-directive-in-france/" target="_blank">here</a>).</li></ul><p>The SGDSN has also published the following guidance:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.dataguidance.com/legal-research/sgdsn-critical-infrastructure-protection-france-january-2017" target="_blank">Critical Infrastructure Protection in France</a> ('the SDGSN Guidance').</li></ul><p>In addition, ANSSI has published various related standards for information security system management. For instance, ANSSI&nbsp;has launched a public consultation on a draft standard (only available in French <a href="https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/uploads/2021/01/anssi-pacs-referentiel_exigences-v0.3.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>) containing requirements and minimum guarantees for providers of&nbsp;information systems security support and advice ('PACS') who are responsible for operations related to risk management and information system protection. The public consultation will end on 19 March 2021.</p><div name="2.SCOPEOFAPPLICATION" data-unique="2.SCOPEOFAPPLICATION"></div><h2>2. SCOPE OF APPLICATION</h2><p>Article 22 of the Military Planning Law aims to standardise a minimum level of cybersecurity for the critical information systems of operators of essential services in France. In particular, over 200 public and private OES from across the 12 sectors were identified. These OES must identify their most critical information systems for which the security requirements must be implemented. OES must provide ANSSI with a list of the identified critical information systems.</p><p>Specifically, the Military Planning Law includes four key measures for OES to follow to ensure the security of their systems. OES must report cybersecurity incidents to ANSSI, comply with the listed technical and organisational measures, cooperate with ANSSI cybersecurity audits, and follow any measures in the event of a major crisis as declared by the Prime Minister.</p><p>The Security Rules constitute organisational and technical measures for basic cyber hygiene. The Security Rules consist of 20 categories and must be respected by all OES as well as any subcontractors across all sectors.</p><p>The Military Planning Law clarifies the list of critical operators to which specific rules apply. The sectors are grouped into four categories, comprised of basic human need sectors, sovereign sectors, economic sectors, and technological sectors. Each sector must comply with the requirements of a sector-specific order. The list of sectors and their respective orders include:</p><ul><li>health (only available in French <a href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000032749532&amp;dateTexte=&amp;categorieLien=id" target="_blank">here</a>);</li><li>food (only available in French <a href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/eli/arrete/2016/6/17/PRMD1612419A/jo" target="_blank">here</a>)</li><li>water (only available in French <a href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000032749580&amp;dateTexte=&amp;categorieLien=id" target="_blank">here</a>);</li><li>telecommunications and broadcasting (only available in French <a href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/eli/arrete/2016/11/28/PRMD1630591A/jo/texte" target="_blank">here</a>);</li><li>space and research (only available in French <a href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000035568177&amp;dateTexte=&amp;categorieLien=id" target="_blank">here</a>);</li><li>industry (only available in French <a href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/eli/arrete/2016/11/28/PRMD1631972A/jo/texte" target="_blank">here</a>);</li><li>electric energy (only available in French <a href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000033063173&amp;dateTexte=&amp;categorieLien=id" target="_blank">here</a>);</li><li>natural gas providers (only available in French <a href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000033063219&amp;dateTexte=&amp;categorieLien=id" target="_blank">here</a>);</li><li>petrol (only available in French <a href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000033063265&amp;dateTexte=&amp;categorieLien=id" target="_blank">here</a>);</li><li>transport (only available in French <a href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000033063265&amp;dateTexte=&amp;categorieLien=id" target="_blank">here</a>);</li><li>finance (only available in French <a href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/eli/arrete/2016/11/28/PRMD1630722A/jo/texte" target="_blank">here</a>);</li><li>civilian administration (only available in French <a href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000038565011&amp;categorieLien=id" target="_blank">here</a>); and</li><li>military activities&nbsp;(only available in French <a href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000035568211&amp;dateTexte=&amp;categorieLien=id" target="_blank">here</a>).</li></ul><div name="3.KEYDEFINITIONS|BASICCONCEPTS" data-unique="3.KEYDEFINITIONS|BASICCONCEPTS"></div><h2>3.

The CIIP Framework in general is aimed towards the security and protection of information systems, where personal data may be included. However, requirements for data processing in itself are not explicitly addressed within the CIIP Framework.</p><p>OES are responsible for ensuring that the provisions of the Military Planning Law and the sectoral order are respected so that the information contained as part of their critical information system is secure. The highly confidential nature of the information increases the importance of its protection.&nbsp;</p><div name="5.MANAGEMENTSYSTEM" data-unique="5.MANAGEMENTSYSTEM"></div><h2><a id="column-2" name="column-2"></a>5. MANAGEMENT SYSTEM</h2><p><strong>Declaration of the critical information system</strong></p><p>OES are required to declare their critical information system to ANSSI in the deadline given within each sectoral order. Declarations must be submitted following specific instructions for the confidential classification, starting with an online form (only available in French <a href="https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/uploads/2016/04/formulaire-declaration-siiv-lpm_anssi.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>), CD version and hard copy. Clear and understandable language must be used so that it could be understood by readers who are unfamiliar with the sector (the OES FAQs).</p><p>Within the declaration, OES must describe the technical elements of the critical information system, including, among other things (the OES FAQs):</p><ul><li>architecture used;</li><li>types of active equipment and the approximate amount of each;</li><li>types of interconnections between each; and</li><li>versions of software, operating system, and firmware used by each equipment.</li></ul><p>ANSSI will give feedback on the declaration and may, as part of this, request that an information system be declared as well as the relevant critical information system (the OES FAQs).</p><p>The updated indicators, as required by the Security Rules, as well as a renewed declaration, must be sent each year between 1 November and 30 November.</p><p><strong>Information assurance policy</strong></p><p>Organisations must consider information system security and any related issues at the highest levels of management. As part of this, OES must define an information system security policy according to ANSSI's criteria for the same, notably with awareness and training programmes for the information security system (the Security Rules).</p><p>In addition, OES must also write an external protection plan, under the authority of the relevant ministry, in order to describe and plan any State intervention required for the system (the SDGSN Guidance).</p><p><strong>Security accreditation</strong></p><p>OES must meet the compulsory requirements for security accreditation, which includes an audit by ANSSI, another government agency or a Trust Service Provider, to demonstrate that all the Security Rules have been appropriately implemented in the critical information system. Costs for audits will be covered by the OES.</p><p>As part of the audit, the individual responsible for the system formally accepts that the high risks to the security of the critical information have been identified, that the necessary measures have been taken and that residual risks have been identified and accepted (the Security Rules and the OES FAQs).</p><p>During this process, OES must implement the obligatory Security Rules, however, sector-specific orders do allow for OES to use alternative measures if technical or operational factors challenge the application of a rule. In such a case, OES must justify any derogation in the accreditation documents and identify the alternative measures which have been used.</p><p>Where a provider is used, the provider conducting the audit must not be the same provider who carried out the audit for certification and the provider must be taken from the list of Qualified Trust Service Providers released by ANSSI (see section 1.3 above).</p><p>OES can appeal against the results of an audit before the audit report is sent. ANSSI can then hear the concerned parties within two months (the OES FAQs).</p><p>As part of taking the necessary measures to guarantee compliance with the Military Planning Law, OES must ensure that service agreements with third party providers, who are responsible for any part of the critical information system, include a clause regarding the ability to conduct audits of the provider (the OES FAQs). See section 10 below for further information on vendor management.</p><p><strong>Roles and responsibilities</strong></p><p>OES must appoint a security liaison officer to act as a direct point of contact between ANSSI and the organisation so that ANSSI can be notified of incidents at any time (the Security Rules).</p><div name="6.DATASECURITY" data-unique="6.DATASECURITY"></div><h2><a id="column-3" name="column-3"></a>6. DATA SECURITY</h2><p><strong>Network mapping</strong></p><p>OES must make available to ANSSI its mapping of each critical information system. The purpose of network mapping is to ensure that OES can evaluate the impact of any security incidents and, in doing so, facilitate the process for handling security incidents (the Security Rules).</p><p><strong>Security maintenance</strong></p><p>OES must ensure that their critical infrastructure information system maintains a consistent and up-to-date level of security in relation to the changing nature of the security threats. As part of this, OES must monitor and consider any corrective measures as well as manage the updates of the critical infrastructure information system (the Security Rules).</p><p><strong>Logging and logging analysis</strong></p><p>OES must implement a logging system for each critical infrastructure information system. In particular, OES must record any activities regarding the critical information system so that security incidents can be searched for and identified and, following any security incident, conduct the necessary investigations (the Security Rules).</p><p>Furthermore, OES should follow ANSSI's recommendations for the implementation of a logging system (only available in French <a href="https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/uploads/IMG/pdf/NP_Journalisation_NoteTech.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>), to facilitate the consultation and analysis of events as they occur, after the occurrence of any security incidents to find its origins, and aid in the evaluation of the method and impact of any cyberattack (the Security Rules).</p><p>Logging analysis must conform with the requirements of the PDIS Standard.</p><p><strong>Identification and authentication</strong></p><p>OES must limit the possible exposure of the critical infrastructure information systems to attack and to operating faults. Furthermore, OES must ensure that any access to the critical infrastructure information system and its resources can be traced. Measures for this can include ensuring identification can be made through individual accounts, protection of confidential information regarding authentication, management of authorisation through the principle of least privilege ('POLP'), and knowledge of the privileges and rights associated to accounts (the Security Rules).</p><p><strong>Administration access control and administration systems</strong></p><p>OES must work to prevent attacks which may lead to a loss of control of the critical infrastructure information system. As part of this, organisations can take measures such as using administrator accounts specifically for such purposes, using hardware and software specifically for administrator operations, and separating the administrator activities from other activities (the Security Rules).</p><p>OES must deactivate, without delay, any user accounts once they are no longer necessary (the Security Rules).</p><p><strong>Traffic monitoring and filtering</strong></p><p>OES must be able to avoid, and at least reduce, any attack to the system. As part of this, OES should deter hackers by investing in counter measures. Measures might include segregation between different parts of the critical information system and external systems, the application of a policy to filter only strictly necessary exchanges, the strict control of remote access, and strengthening of all elements of the critical information system (the Security Rules).</p><p><strong>Indicators</strong></p><p>OES must be able to evaluate the degree of exposure to cyberattack which their critical information system faces and refine the protection strategies. To achieve this, OES should evaluate each critical information systems for information security system indicators and send to ANSSI, on an annual basis, a table which tracks these indicators (the Security Rules).</p><div name="7.ACCOUNTABILITYANDRECORDKEEPING" data-unique="7.ACCOUNTABILITYANDRECORDKEEPING"></div><h2><a id="column-4" name="column-4"></a>7. ACCOUNTABILITY AND RECORDKEEPING</h2><p>OES must be able to describe and define any notifications made by ANSSI's partners. As part of this, OES must make available to ANSSI the mapping of each critical infrastructure information system (the Security Rules).</p><p>OES should evaluate each critical information systems for information security system indicators and send to ANSSI, on an annual basis, a table which tracks these indicators (the Security Rules). See section 6 above for further information on indicators.</p><p>OES can delegate the notification of security incidents to third party providers. However, the OES remains responsible for notification of security incidents and must clarify contractual obligations with any such provider (the OES FAQs).</p><div name="8.DATASUBJECTRIGHTS" data-unique="8.DATASUBJECTRIGHTS"></div><h2><a id="column-5" name="column-5"></a>8. DATA SUBJECT RIGHTS</h2><p>The CIIP Framework does not contain specific guidance relating explicitly to data subject rights and the victim of a security incident is identified more as the organisation who has been the subject of a security incident rather than an individual. As a result, the CIIP Framework in general is aimed towards the security and protection of information systems, rather than specifically catering towards the data subject. However, the importance of ensuring the protection and security of individual's information which might be contained within the systems can be implied.</p><div name="9.CROSS-BORDERDATATRANSFERSANDLOCALISATION" data-unique="9.CROSS-BORDERDATATRANSFERSANDLOCALISATION"></div><h2><a id="column-6" name="column-6"></a>9. CROSS-BORDER DATA TRANSFERS AND LOCALISATION</h2><p>The CIIP Framework does not contain specific guidance relating explicitly to data transfers and localisation. However, the importance of ensuring the security of critical information system and its contained information at all times and throughout all activities is heavily implied throughout.</p><p>Audits in particular, however, concern only the specified supervised perimeter which comprises the physical, technical or organisational boundaries within which all or part of the audited information system exists.</p><div name="10.VENDORMANAGEMENT" data-unique="10.VENDORMANAGEMENT"></div><h2><a id="column-7" name="column-7"></a>10. VENDOR MANAGEMENT</h2><p>In particular, OES must take the necessary measures, preferably by the means of a contract or service agreement, to guarantee the application of the security measures by any subcontractors. OES should consult with ANSSI to resolve any difficulties. As a result, the Security Rules also apply to critical information systems operated by subcontractors.</p><p>Organisations must inform ANSSI of any third party providers who host, operate or maintain the critical information system (the OES FAQs).</p><p>In addition, logging systems and detection systems can be implemented by an OES or a third party provider, whether they are qualified trust service providers or not, as long as the activities comply with the requirements of the PDIS Standard. ANSSI does however recommend that the use of a provider would facilitate demonstrating compliance during audits (the OES FAQs). See section 6 for further information on requirements for logging.</p><p>Furthermore, OES can delegate the notification of security incidents to third party providers. However, the OES remains responsible for notification of security incidents and must clarify contractual obligations with any such provider (the OES FAQs).</p><div name="11.INCIDENTANDBREACH" data-unique="11.INCIDENTANDBREACH"></div><h2><a id="column-8" name="column-8"></a>11. INCIDENT AND BREACH</h2><p>Under the Military Planning Law, OES must notify ANSSI of any incidents occurring on their critical information systems. The types of incidents which must be notified have been specified by sector-specific orders. ANSSI is responsible to protect the confidentiality of the OES when handling an incident notification.</p><p>Following a security incident, OES must inform ANSSI through the notification form. ANSSI will then provide support, which may consist of recommendations and onsite support and possibly share feedback on the incident with sectoral ministries as well as anonymised information with other OES to prevent potential future attacks. The OES may decide to voluntarily exchange information with fellow OES.</p><p>OES must be able to describe the impact of specific types of attack to the critical information system in terms of functioning and key objectives.</p><p><strong>Detection</strong></p><p>According to the Security Rule regarding detection of incidents, OES must be able to identify any attempts to attack critical infrastructure information systems at the earliest possible moment and respond quickly to any such security events.</p><p>Security incident detection providers in particular are required to implement a system of logging correlation and analysis based on the requirements of the PDIS Standard as well as implementing accredited systems for detection as operated by ANSSI, another government agency or accredited providers. These detection systems should be utilised in such a way as to allow analysis of exchanges between the critical infrastructure information system and other systems (the Security Rules).</p><p>Systems for the detection of security incidents are subject to security assessments and business assessments to assess their performance and effectiveness before they can be certified. Furthermore, detection systems must continue to respond to allow for the capacity to analyse all possible flows between critical information systems and third party information systems (the OES FAQs).</p><p>OES does not require a third party detection service provider and can act as their own only when they are certified by ANSSI for this (the OES FAQs).</p><p><strong>Handling security incidents </strong></p><p>OES must put in place a policy for the management of information security incidents. The policy must ensure the management and monitoring of any security incidents, implementing the appropriate resources for the analysis and processing of such incidents. (the Security Rules).</p><p>The management of security incidents must comply with the PRIS Standard.</p><p>A specific information system should be implemented for the handling of security incidents, in particular for the storage of reports analysing any security incidents (the OES FAQs).</p><p><strong>Handling security alerts </strong></p><p>OES must be informed of any risk to the security of critical infrastructure information system as quickly as possible and be able to quickly commence response procedures in order to limit the scope of the incident and its impact. OES must appoint a security liaison officer to act as a direct point of contact between ANSSI and the organisation so that ANSSI can be notified of incidents at any time (the Security Rules).</p><p>Obligatory notification of security incidents to ANSSI intend to allow for specialised assistance for the affected parties, quick and specific evaluation of the threat, and an organised collective response to major cyberattacks (the OES FAQs).</p><p>OES can notify ANSSI of security incidents through sending the appropriate forms by post or secured electronic means as required for the confidential nature of the information (the OES FAQs).</p><p>ANSSI must receive the following information:</p><ul><li>a detailed description of the event, the impact and the measures taken; and</li><li>the technical data allowing ANSSI to assess the incident.</li></ul><p><strong>Crisis management</strong></p><p>OES must be prepared to commence the measures for a crisis situation as allocated by the Prime Minister. In particular, OES must implement a procedure for crisis management in the event of a major cyberattack (the Security Rules).</p><div name="12.PRIVACYBYDESIGN" data-unique="12.PRIVACYBYDESIGN"></div><h2><a id="column-9" name="column-9"></a>12.
