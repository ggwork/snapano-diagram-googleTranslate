Definitions</h2><p><strong>SMS/MMS</strong>: Included in the definition of 'electronic communications', which are transmissions or receptions of signs, signals, writings, images, or sounds by electromagnetic means (Article L32(1Â°) of the Communications Code).</p><p><strong>SMS/MMS marketing</strong>: There is no definition of 'SMS/MMS marketing' in French law. However, 'direct marketing' is defined as the sending of any message intended to promote, directly or indirectly, goods, services or the image of a person selling goods or providing services. Messages intended to induce the user or subscriber to call to send a premium rate text message are also considered direct marketing (Article L34-5 of the Communications Code).</p><p><strong>Consent</strong>: Any free, specific, and informed demonstration of will by which a person agrees to the use of their personal data for direct marketing purposes (Article L34-5 of the Communications Code). It must be obtained through a positive act by the individual (Article 4 (11) of the GDPR, the Referential).</p><div name="3.ConsentRequirements" data-unique="3.ConsentRequirements"></div><h2>3. Consent Requirements</h2><div name="3.1.B2C" data-unique="3.1.B2C"></div><h3><a id="column-3" name="column-3"></a>3.1. B2C</h3><p>Organisations are required to obtain the prior consent of recipients before sending SMS/MMS marketing messages to natural persons for commercial purposes in the business to consumer ('B2C') context (Article L34-5 of the Communications Code and the SMS Guidance).</p><p>Organisations must obtain consent at the time the individual's contact details are collected, i.e. when subscribing to a service, and inform individuals that their contact details would be used for marketing purposes (the SMS Guidance).</p><div name="3.2.B2B" data-unique="3.2.B2B"></div><h3><a id="column-4" name="column-4"></a>3.2. B2B</h3><p>Prior consent is not required when sending business to business ('B2B') SMS/MMS marketing messages to the main company telephone number (opt-out).</p><p>With regard to SMS/MMS marketing messages sent to specific employees of a legal entity, marketing via SMS/MMS is possible provided that the data subjects (including employees) have explicitly agreed to be approached at the time of the collection of their electronic address (opt-in).</p><p>With regard to professional addresses of employees (i.e. nameoftheemployee@nameofthecompany.fr), it is possible to send marketing emails on the condition that the recipient was informed at the time of the collection of their details that their email address would be used for marketing purposes and given the opportunity to opt-out in a free and simple way. Furthermore, the subject of the email must also relate to the profession of the person being solicited. For example, sending an email about software to an IT manager is acceptable without their prior consent. However, if the marketing is not related to the employee's profession, the opt-in rule applies (the Email Guidance).</p><div name="3.3Exceptions" data-unique="3.3Exceptions"></div><h3>3.3 Exceptions</h3><p>The processing of personal data for direct marketing purposes may be regarded as carried out for a legitimate interest (Recital 47 of the GDPR, the Referential).</p><p>There are two exceptions to the consent requirements:</p><ul><li>organisations may send SMS/MMS marketing messages to individuals who are already their customers regarding similar products or services they have purchased; or</li><li>organisations are not required to obtain the prior consent of the recipients before sending SMS/MMS marketing messages if these are not of a commercial nature (i.e. charitable, political, or religious SMS-MMS).</li></ul><p>In both cases, the person must, at the time of collection of their phone number be informed that their number will be used for marketing purposes, and have the opportunity to request, free of charge, to stop receiving SMS/MMS messages (SMS of a Commercial Character: The Right Habits).</p><div name="3.4.AdditionalRequirements" data-unique="3.4.AdditionalRequirements"></div><h3>3.4. Additional Requirements</h3><p>When sending SMS/MMS marketing messages, organisations must specify their identity and provide a simple way to opt-out from receiving any future messages. CNIL recommends that the prior consent or the right of opposition be collected by means of a checkbox (Article L34-5 of the Post and Telecommunications Code and the SMS-MMS Marketing). A pre-checked box would not be an affirmative action qualifying as express consent and would therefore be illegal.</p><p>Organisations are also prohibited from providing a purpose for messages that are unrelated to the service offered (Article L34-5 of the Post and Telecommunications Code).</p><p><strong>Right to object</strong></p><p>Where personal data is processed for direct marketing purposes, the data subject has the right to object at any time to processing of personal data concerning them for such marketing, which includes profiling (Article 21 of the GDPR).</p><p>The data subject should be able to exercise the right to object whether with regard to initial or further processing, at any time and free of charge, and such right should be explicitly brought to their attention and presented clearly and separately from any other information (Recital 70 of the GDPR).</p><p><strong>Children</strong></p><p>Specific protection should be provided with regard to personal data of children for the purposes of marketing or creating personality or user profiles when using services offered directly to a child (Recital 38 of the GDPR).</p><p>Companies mainly targeting a public of minors should ensure a specific notice appears on the collection forms stating that the legal representative consents to the collection of information on the minor in their care, if the latter is under 16 years old (point 26 of the Email Charter).</p><div name="4.MarketingLists" data-unique="4.MarketingLists"></div><h2>4. Marketing Lists</h2><p>When they intend to scrape publicly available data online, organisations must ensure that the terms of use of the website they intend to scrape data from does not forbid such a collection. Moreover, organisations must ensure to collect the data subjects' consent if the data subjects who made their data public did not reasonably expect to be the subject of marketing by another company. The mere acceptance by an internet user, in a general and non-specific manner, of the terms of use of a service cannot be regarded as a specific consent, even if these terms of use inform the user that they may receive marketing materials by physical or electronic means (the Repurposing Data Guidance).</p><p>The collected data must not exceed the minimal requirements, especially concerning special categories of data.</p><p>Organisations transmitting the data must collect this consent, on behalf of the recipients, at the time of the initial collection of the data. To do so, individuals must be informed of the identity of the data controller partners who would use their data for marketing purposes, through an exhaustive list made available directly on or from the collection medium (e.g., by including a hyperlink), as well as the specific purpose of the transmission (the Referential).</p><p>Otherwise, the recipients of the data must collect consent themselves by soliciting the data subjects, which constitutes a processing of personal data operation which must be based on the recipient's documented legitimate interest, and cannot itself be considered as a commercial proposition (the Referential).</p><p>Organisations are required to inform in a clear and plain way, at the latest upon the first contact with the data subjects, all information provided in Article 14 of the GDPR, and namely on the purposes of the processing and the source of the data.</p><div name="5.NationalOpt-OutList" data-unique="5.NationalOpt-OutList"></div><h2><a id="column-5" name="column-5"></a>5.

The amount of the fine may be increased according to the benefits derived from the offense, up to 10% of the annual average turnover (Article L121-7, 3Â° and L132-11, respectively, of the Consumer Code).</p><p><strong>GDPR</strong></p><p>The infringement of Article 21 of the GDPR may lead to an administrative fine of up to â¬20 million or, in the case of an undertaking, up to 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher (Article 83(5) of the GDPR).</p><p>The infringement of other obligations under the GDPR may lead to the imposition of additional administrative fines, in line with Article 83 of the GDPR.</p></div></div></div>
