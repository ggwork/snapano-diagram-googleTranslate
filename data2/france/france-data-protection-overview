Key acts, regulations, directives, bills</h3><p>Historically, France has been subject to the unamended 1978 Act, creating CNIL. It was enacted following the so-called 'SAFARI' scandal revealed in 1974 in Le Monde regarding the French administration's plan to interconnect nominative files via social security numbers creating thus the need to regulate the use of personal data.</p><p>The 1978 Act has been amended several times, including by the Law No. 2004-801 as of 6 August 2004 implementing the Directive 95/46/CE on protection of personal data (only available in French <a href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000441676" target="_blank">here</a>), and in 2016 by the Act for a Digital Republic as of 7 October 2016 ('the Digital Republic Act') (only available in French <a href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/eli/loi/2016/10/7/ECFI1524250L/jo" target="_blank">here</a>), which anticipated the <a href="https://platform.dataguidance.com/cross-border-charts/general-data-protection-regulation" target="_blank">General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679)</a> ('GDPR') regarding algorithms, children, anonymisation of criminal data in court decisions, financial sanctions, and most importantly France's characteristic feature: digital inheritance.</p><p>Almost a month after the entry into force of the GDPR, notwithstanding an emergency enactment procedure and the submission of provisions to the <a href="https://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/" target="_blank">Conseil Constitutionnel</a><u> </u>to ensure compliance with the French Constitution of 4 October 1958 (only available in French <a href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006071194" target="_blank">here</a>), the Amendment Law finally modified Act No.78-17 of 6 January 1978 on Data Processing, Data Files and Individual Liberties (official version available in French <a href="https://www.cnil.fr/fr/la-loi-informatique-et-libertes" target="_blank">here</a>; unofficial English version available <a href="https://platform.dataguidance.com/legal-research/act-no78-17-6-january-1978-data-processing-data-files-and-individual-liberties-0" target="_blank">here</a>) ('the Act') with a retroactive entry into force on 25 May 2018.</p><p>At that time, the GDPR implementation technique was characterised by France's symbolic choice to maintain the 1978 Act's architecture, preserving the principles that were identified 40 years ago by the legislator, and repealing only contradictory provisions. However, this method led to unsatisfactory results in terms of legibility. Some provisions appeared redundant, while others were unclear with regards to their practical application or resulted in having a meaning diverging substantially from the GDPR provisions.</p><p>The first enforcement decree, published on 3 August 2018, Decree No. 2018-687 of 1 August 2018 (only available in French <a href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000037277401&amp;categorieLien=id" target="_blank">here</a>) ('Decree No. 2018-687'), specifies the organisation and functioning of CNIL (e.g. quorum, investigations, cooperation with other European authorities, complaint filling through an online form), provides that CNIL is to publish the lists of processing operations for which a Data Protection Impact Assessment is required ('DPIA Blacklist') (CNIL has since fulfilled its mandate to issue its DPIA Blacklist in <a href="https://www.dataguidance.com/legal-research/france-dpia-blacklist" target="_blank">Deliberation No. 2018-328 of 11 October 2018</a> (the full DPIA Blacklist issued by CNIL including examples of such blacklisted processing operations is only available in French <a href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000037559518&amp;categorieLien=id" target="_blank">here</a>), details the data subjects' rights (e.g. conditions and guarantees under which the rights of access, rectification, restriction and opposition may be waived in the event of data processing for scientific, historical research or statistical purposes), establishes the list of categories of data processing (administrative, financial, operational, and medical) which may derogate from the data breach notification obligations, and coordinates the <a href="https://platform.dataguidance.com/legal-research/code-civil-procedure-0" target="_blank">Code of Civil Procedure</a> and the <a href="https://platform.dataguidance.com/legal-research/penal-code-10-december-2005" target="_blank">Penal Code</a> ('the Penal Code') in particular for the processing of criminal records.</p><p>With these clarifications provided, the criticisms raised by the Amendment Law were resolved with the adoption of the 2018 Ordinance, which finally modified the architecture of the 1978 Act by rewriting the entire text in order to improve its legibility, ensure consistency with other regulations in force, and correct any error and omission for coherence with the GDPR.</p><p>The Act is now organised around five titles relating to:</p><ul><li>common provisions including definitions of the essential concepts by express reference to the GDPR, the material and territorial scope of application, the fundamental principles of personal data protection, the rules on sensitive data as well as those on the organisation and functioning of CNIL, and finally the criminal provisions (Article 1 to 41 of the Act);</li><li>personal data processing provisions as provided for in the GDPR (Article 42 to 86 of the Act);</li><li>personal data processing provisions as provided for in the <a href="https://platform.dataguidance.com/legal-research/data-protection-directive-respect-law-enforcement-directive-eu-2016680" target="_blank">Data Protection Directive with Respect to Law Enforcement (Directive (EU) 2016/680)</a> ('the Data Protection Directive') (Article 87 to 114 of the Act);</li><li>exclusively national personal data processing provisions concerning State security and defence (Article 115 to 124 of the Act); and</li><li>personal data processing provisions regarding Overseas France (i.e. French-administered territories outside Europe) (Article 125 to 128 of the Act).</li></ul><p>According to Article 3 of the amended Act, its provisions apply to the processing of personal data carried out in the context of the activities of a controller or processor established in France, whether or not the processing takes place in France.</p><p>Furthermore, and in addition to Decree No. 2018-687 which specifies the modalities of application and certain provisions of the Act and sets out more precisely the time periods and procedural rules applicable to the missions and powers of CNIL, other enforcement decrees were enacted to finalise French law's adaptation to European personal data protection regulations.</p><p>In particular, Decree No. 2019-536 of 29 May 2019 (only available in French <a href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000038528420&amp;categorieLien=id" target="_blank">here</a>) ('the Implementing Decree') was published, constituting the final step in bringing national law into line with the GDPR. The Implementing Decree ensures the consistency of the revised 1978 Act with European regulation, specifies data subjects' rights, adapts procedural rules before CNIL, repeals Decree No. 2005-1309 of 20 October 2005 (only available in French <a href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000241445" target="_blank">here</a>), and above all brings into force the Act as amended by the Ordinance No. 2018-1125.</p><p>Therefore, it is still the provisions of the 1978 Act integrating the GDPR and its decrees that set the general framework applicable to the protection of personal data in France.</p><div name="1.2.Guidelines" data-unique="1.2.Guidelines"></div><h3>1.2. Guidelines</h3><p>CNIL regularly publishes guidance, mainly only available in French, on its website which, for the moment, relates more to the GDPR than the Act itself. Among such guidance, the following should be highlighted:</p><ul><li>The Six-Step GDPR Compliance Methodology (only available in French <a href="https://www.cnil.fr/fr/principes-cles/rgpd-se-preparer-en-6-etapes" target="_blank"><u>here</u></a>);</li><li>Recommendations on Data Protection Officers ('DPOs') (only available in French <a href="https://www.cnil.fr/fr/le-delegue-la-protection-des-donnees-dpo" target="_blank"><u>here</u></a>);</li><li>Guidance on ISO 27701 and the Processing of Personal Data or Personally Identifiable Information (only available in French <a href="https://www.cnil.fr/en/iso-27701-international-standard-addressing-personal-data-protection" target="_blank"><u>here</u></a>);</li><li>Guidance on the Right to Delisting (only available in French <a href="https://www.cnil.fr/en/right-de-listing-questions" target="_blank"><u>here</u></a>);</li><li>Guidelines on cookies and other trackers (only available in French <u><a href="https://www.cnil.fr/sites/default/files/atoms/files/lignes_directrices_de_la_cnil_sur_les_cookies_et_autres_traceurs.pdf" target="_blank"><u>here</u></a></u>);</li><li>Guidelines on Data Protection Impact Assessment ('DPIA') (only available in French <u><a href="https://www.cnil.fr/fr/decisions/lignes-directrices-recommandations-CNIL" target="_blank"><u>here</u></a></u>);&nbsp;</li><li>Guidance on notification (only available in French <a href="https://www.cnil.fr/fr/declarer-un-fichier" style="box-sizing:border-box" target="_blank">here</a>); and</li><li>various other guidelines on different topics such as anonymisation techniques, passwords, Binding Corporate Rules ('BCRs'), personal data breach notification, consent, and profiling (only available in French <a href="https://www.cnil.fr/fr/reglement-europeen/lignes-directrices" target="_blank"><u>here</u></a>).</li></ul><p>In addition to general guidance, CNIL has also published a range of GDPR compliance tools, including <a href="https://www.cnil.fr/en/open-source-pia-software-helps-carry-out-data-protection-impact-assesment" target="_blank"><u>Privacy Impact Assessment Software</u></a> and an open source software to detect cookies deposited on users’ devices by websites (only available in French <u><a href="https://linc.cnil.fr/fr/cookieviz-une-dataviz-en-temps-reel-du-tracking-de-votre-navigation" target="_blank"><u>here</u></a>)</u>.</p><p>CNIL is also in the process of transforming its now-obsolete instruments, such as authorisation procedures, into soft law guidance. In the meantime, CNIL explained that its deliberations and authorisations can be used to 'orientate conformity' before new reference documents, such as the Standard on Processing of Personal Data for the purposes of Debt Management (only available in French <a href="https://www.cnil.fr/sites/default/files/atoms/files/referentiel-gestion-impayes.pdf" target="_blank"><u>here</u></a>) and the Standard on Processing of Personal Data for the purposes of Commercial Activities (only available in French <a href="https://www.cnil.fr/sites/default/files/atoms/files/referentiel-gestion-commerciale.pdf" target="_blank"><u>here</u></a>), are published.</p><div name="1.3.Caselaw" data-unique="1.3.Caselaw"></div><h3>1.3. Case law</h3><p>Since the entry into force of the GDPR, CNIL has sanctioned several violations in breach of the legislation and issued warnings against companies (all available sanctions only available in French <a href="https://www.cnil.fr/fr/tag/sanctions" target="_blank">here</a>).</p><p>For example, sanctions have notably been imposed for:</p><ul><li>failure to respect the right to object to processing;</li><li>failure to comply with the obligation to process adequate and relevant data;</li><li>failure to provide information to the data subjects;</li><li>failure to cooperate with the supervisory authority;</li><li>data security breaches; and</li><li>lack of transparency, unsatisfactory information and lack of valid consent for advertising (notably against Google for €50 million on 21 January 2019 (only available in French <a href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCnil.do?oldAction=rechExpCnil&amp;id=CNILTEXT000038032552&amp;fastReqId=2103387945&amp;fastPos=1" target="_blank">here</a>)).</li></ul><div name="2.ScopeofApplication" data-unique="2.ScopeofApplication"></div><h2><strong>2.&nbsp;Scope of Application</strong></h2><div name="2.1.Personalscope" data-unique="2.1.Personalscope"></div><h3><a id="column-3" name="column-3"></a>2.1.

However, for processing carried out for journalistic, academic, artistic or literary expression purposes the national rules applicable are those to which the data controller is subject when it is established in the European Union.</p><div name="2.3.Materialscope" data-unique="2.3.Materialscope"></div><h3><a id="column-5" name="column-5"></a>2.3.

Main regulator for data protection</h3><p>CNIL is the national supervisory authority according to the meaning and for the application of the GDPR. It is an independent administrative authority composed of 18 members, including parliamentarians, representatives of high jurisdictions, qualified public figures, and a chairperson.</p><p>As to institutional proceedings, the members congregate in plenary sessions and, since 2004, CNIL's Restricted Committee, which is composed of five members and a Chair, can impose diverse sanctions in case of non-compliance with data protection legislations.</p><div name="3.2.Mainpowers,dutiesandresponsibilities" data-unique="3.2.Mainpowers,dutiesandresponsibilities"></div><h3>3.2. Main powers, duties and responsibilities</h3><p>As the French data protection authority, CNIL's main mission is to control and audit compliance with data protection legislations and impose sanctions in case of a failure to remedy breaches.</p><p>Under the GDPR, CNIL's right to gain entry and inspection remain essentially the same as it was under the previous French data protection regime, and while the nature of premises regarding on-site searches is more clearly specified, it is still subject to professional secrecy. The Act now also provides for the possibility to use a borrowed identity for online controls (even though the power to conduct online audits was established in 2014).</p><p>At the end of the audit process, CNIL examines the gathered information and documents and drafts an inspection report. When the breaches are noted as serious, CNIL can impose sanctions. However, the <a href="https://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/en" target="_blank">Constitutional Council</a> ruled that neither the warnings nor the formal notices pronounced by CNIL's chairperson according to Article 20 of the Act constitute 'sanctions' that are punitive in nature.</p><p>In addition to its historical responsibilities, CNIL is awarded the power to adopt or encourage the development of new soft law instruments (such as guidelines, recommendations, codes of conduct, model regulations, reference methodologies for health data processing, certification mechanisms, etc).</p><p>Furthermore, since 2020, the European cooperation has increased and its mechanisms are now an integral part of CNIL's activity in the context of cross-border processing controls. For instance, CNIL participated in close cooperation with Luxembourg data protection authority to the procedure led against Amazon Europe Core that resulted in one the highest sanction pronounced by a European data protection authority to date (although the decision is not enforceable yet). The claim was addressed to the CNIL by a French association.</p><p>For 2021, CNIL's control program (published on 2 March 2021) focused on the following areas: cybersecurity of websites, security of health data and use of cookies. These three major concerns led to the publication of:</p><ul><li>a guide on Ransomware Attacks, how to anticipate and react in case of an incident, was published by the <a href="https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/en/" target="_blank">National Cybersecurity Agency of France</a> ('ANSSI') and the <a href="http://www.justice.gouv.fr/multilinguisme-12198/english-12200/justice-in-france-22126.html">Ministry of Justice</a> (only available in French <a href="https://www.ssi.gouv.fr/uploads/2020/09/anssi-guide-attaques_par_rancongiciels_tous_concernes-v1.0.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>);</li><li>three new sets of guidelines adopted by the CNIL to assist medical and paramedical professionals complying with their obligations in relation to the processing of health data; and</li><li>two practical guides related to retention periods applicable to health data for health sector professionals (the first one applies to all health sectors to the exception of research while the second one only applies to the field of health research).</li></ul><div name="4.KeyDefinitions" data-unique="4.KeyDefinitions"></div><h2><strong>4.&nbsp;Key Definitions</strong></h2><p><strong><a id="column-7" name="column-7"></a>Data controller:&nbsp;</strong>There is no definition of 'data controller' in the Act. Article 2 refers to the definitions provided by Article 4 of the GDPR. Thus, a data controller is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data.</p><p><strong><a id="column-8" name="column-8"></a>Data processor:&nbsp;</strong>Article 2 provides for the application of the definition of 'data processor' provided in Article 4 of the GDPR. Thus, a data processor is natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which processes personal data on behalf of the controller.</p><p><strong><a id="column-9" name="column-9"></a>Personal data:&nbsp;</strong>There is no definition of 'personal data' in the Act. Article 2 of the Act refers to the definitions provided by article 4 of the GDPR. Thus, personal data is any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person.</p><p><strong>Data subject:</strong> There is no definition of 'data subject' in the Act. Article 2 provides for the application of the definition provided in Article 4 of the GDPR. Thus, a data subject is an identified or identifiable natural person.</p><p><strong><a id="column-10" name="column-10"></a>Sensitive data:&nbsp;</strong>There is no definition of 'sensitive data' in the Act. However, Article 6 of the Act provides for the same definition as Article 9 of the GDPR.</p><p><strong><a id="column-11" name="column-11"></a>Health data:&nbsp;</strong>There is no definition of 'health data' in the Act. Article 2 provides for the application of the definition provided in Article 4 of the GDPR. Thus, health data means personal data related to the physical or mental health of a natural person.</p><p><strong><a id="column-12" name="column-12"></a>Biometric data:&nbsp;</strong>There is no definition of 'biometric data' in the Act. Article 2 provides for the application of the definition provided in Article 4 of the GDPR. Thus, biometric data is personal data resulting from specific technical processing relating to the physical, physiological or behavioural characteristics of a natural person, which allow or confirm the unique identification of that natural person.</p><p><strong><a id="column-13" name="column-13"></a>Pseudonymisation:&nbsp;</strong>There is no definition of 'pseudonymisation' in the Act. Article 2 provides for the application of the definition provided in Article 4 of the GDPR.

It allows data subjects to provide guidelines as to the fate of their data after death (erasure/retention of data or communication to a third party). Even though it was initially targeting social media companies, it applies to every organisation. A person can be designated to carry out these instructions, and thus has authority, upon the death of the data subject, to read the directives and request their implementation by the concerned controller. These guidelines can be general (where they relate to all data concerning the data subject) or specific (where they only concern specific data processing operations):</p><ul><li>general guidelines can be entrusted to a trusted third party which will be certified by CNIL; or</li><li>special guidelines can also be entrusted to controllers (social networks, online messaging, etc.) in the event of death; they are subject to the specific consent of the data subject and may not result solely from the latter's approval of the general conditions of use.</li></ul><p>In the absence of guidelines, the heirs have the possibility to exercise certain rights, including the right of access if necessary, to settle the deceased's estate.</p><div name="9.Penalties" data-unique="9.Penalties"></div><h2><strong><a id="column-39" name="column-39"></a>9.&nbsp;</strong>Penalties</h2><p>The Act specifies the formal powers of CNIL, and its Restricted Committee and/or chairperson, to take corrective actions and impose sanctions in case of breach by controllers or processors of their obligations under the GDPR or the Act, or against a certification body (Articles 20 to 23 of the Act).</p><p>Whereas the sanction procedure under the previous regime was conducted in two steps (an optional notice phase followed by an adversarial sanction phase), CNIL's chairperson or Restricted Committee can now carry out actions and impose sanctions, when there is a need to act in order to protect the rights and liberties of data subjects, in the following graduated manner (Article 20 of the Act):</p><ul><li>initial warning;</li><li>formal notice to comply within a certain period ; and</li></ul><p>if the controller/processor is still in breach, it can:</p><ul><li>issue a call to order;</li><li>issue an injunction to comply with the GDPR or the FDPA (under penalty of up to € 100 000 per late day);</li><li>order temporary or definitive restriction on processing;</li><li>prohibit processing or withdraw an authorisation under the GDPR or the FDPA; and/or</li><li>suspend of data flow to a third-party country or international organisation.</li></ul><p>Pursuant to Article 20 of the Act, coercive actions and financial sanctions may not always be preceded by a formal notice. This principle was confirmed by the Conseil d’Etat in a decision dated 9 October 2020 and applied by the CNIL against Le Figaro, as stated in <a href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/cnil/id/CNILTEXT000043867129/" target="_blank">decision of 27 July 2021</a>imposing a financial penalty of €50.000 for violations relating to the use of cookies (only available in French <a href="https://www.cnil.fr/en/cookies-penalty-50000-euros-against-societe-du-figaro" target="_blank">here</a>).</p><p>Corrective actions and sanctions can also be carried out and/or imposed in case of urgency, such as temporary interruption of processing, restriction of processing and suspension of the controller/processor's certification, and the new power to request an urgent opinion or a binding decision from the <a href="https://edpb.europa.eu/" target="_blank"><u>European Data Protection Board</u></a> ('EDPB') (Article 21(III) of the Act). However, in practice, CNIL rarely applies large sanctions and prefers a more cooperative approach, discussing with the controller/processor and working with them towards compliance.</p><p>The Act provides for the possible publication of sanctions in newspapers or other media, as a sanction, at the expense of the breaching party, and where, for instance, a high number of data subjects is involved (Article 22 of the Act).</p><p>In addition, it should be noted that the 2018 Ordinance added to the arsenal of criminal offences of the Act the fact of obstructing the action of CNIL, now punishable by a €15,000 fine (multiplied by five for legal entities) and one year's imprisonment (Article 226-22-2 of the Penal Code).</p><p>Finally, any administrative fine imposed by CNIL may be deducted from a criminal fine imposed by a French criminal judge in a pending similar procedure.</p><p>The GDPR provides for a €20 million cap or 4% of global turnover, for acts committed after 25 May 2018. The Digital Republic Act<strong> </strong>already anticipated and previously increased the maximum amount for fines from €150,000 to €3 million. In addition, controllers became obligated to individually inform data subjects of such sanction, and CNIL started being able to impose financial penalties without prior notice where the violation could not be brought into conformity.</p><p><strong>Class action</strong></p><p>The Act provides for an individual compensation procedure in relation to class actions (Article 37 of the Act). Class actions for consumer and competition law breaches were implemented in 2014 and their scope was extended in 2016 to other matters including personal data protection, discrimination, labour law, environmental law and health.</p><p>Therefore, although data protection class actions are not new under French law, their scope was limited before the GDPR as they were only aimed at stopping a breach and did not provide for the possibility for data subjects to claim compensation. These compensation claims are now possible in court under the GDPR regime as included in Chapter 1 of Title V of the Act No. 2016-1547 (only available in French <a href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do;jsessionid=D3374244FA2A80BEE4D3B51B126EE9CE.tplgfr21s_2?cidTexte=JORFTEXT000033418805&amp;dateTexte=29990101" target="_blank"><u>here</u></a>) and Chapter X of Title VII of Book VII of the Code of Administrative Justice (only available in French <a href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCode.do?cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006070933" target="_blank"><u>here</u></a>) provides procedural provisions dealing with class actions brought before a competent civil or administrative court.</p><p>The class of individuals who can bring an action is limited to:</p><ul><li>certain privacy associations, provided they have been 'regularly declared' (i.e. they have made the necessary declaration to the relevant prefecture (of title, object, registered offices of the association as well as information on the persons responsible for its administration);</li><li>consumers' associations (where the processing of the personal data affects consumers); and</li><li>employees or civil servants' trade union representatives.</li></ul><p>In addition, the class of individuals who can bring an action includes organisations whose object is relating to the protection of rights and freedoms or involves the defence of interests in relation to the purposes of the contentious processing (Article 38 of the Act) but only for the exercise of the data subjects' rights.</p><p>The judge may order, upon request during trial, a collective liquidation damages procedure, or, after trial, individual compensation procedure. Persons wishing to be compensated must belong to the class and apply individually by addressing a request to the person found liable or, if he or she has not responded to that request, to the claimant who then receives a warrant to seize the judge for compensation. Individual compensation can also be obtained through mediation.</p><div name="9.1Enforcementdecisions" data-unique="9.1Enforcementdecisions"></div><h3><a id="column-40" name="column-40"></a>9.1 Enforcement decisions</h3><p>CNIL has issued various enforcement actions, which include the following, among others.</p><p>On 21 January 2019, CNIL imposed a financial penalty of €50 million against Google LLC, in accordance with the GDPR, for lack of transparency, inadequate information and lack of valid consent regarding personalised advertising.
