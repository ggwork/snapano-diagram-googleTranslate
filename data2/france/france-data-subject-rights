Specifically, the Act provides for the right of the data subject to give instructions in relation to the storage, communication, or erasure of their personal data after death (Article 85 of the Act).</p><div name="3.3.Whataretheformatrequirements?" data-unique="3.3.Whataretheformatrequirements?"></div><h3>3.3.

In addition, this restriction applies when the processing is carried out by public authorities responsible for official tasks, such as tax and customs administration&nbsp;or audits of the activity of natural or legal persons which may lead to the detection of a breach and the imposition of a penalty (Article 48 of the Act).</p><p>The Act also provides specific exemptions from the full application of data subject rights when processing is for the purposes of:</p><ul><li>archival purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research, or statistical purposes (Article 79 of the Act);</li><li>journalistic, literary, or artistic expression (Article 80 of the Act); or</li><li>prevention, investigation, and prosecution of criminal offences (Articles 107 and 108 of the Act).</li></ul><div name="4.RightofAccess" data-unique="4.RightofAccess"></div><h2><strong><a id="column-2" name="column-2"></a>4.

If the identity of a person is already established, for instance through a customer identification number, it is not necessary to attach a copy of the identity document. In addition, online authentication in a digital environment may be sufficient. However, if there are reasonable doubts about the identity of the person making the request, additional supporting documents may be requested provided that such requests are not disproportionate, irrelevant, or abusive, in light of the context of the request (the Access Guidelines).</p><p>Moreover, CNIL highlights that individuals may give a mandate to their person of choice to exercise the right of access on their behalf. In this case, the chosen person must submit a letter specifying the purpose of the mandate (to exercise the right of access), the identity of the requester (the identity of the applicant who exercises their right of access to their personal data), and the agent (their identity).
