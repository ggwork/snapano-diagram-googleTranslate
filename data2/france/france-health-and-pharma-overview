Governing Texts</h2><p>The relationship between pharmaceutical regulation and data privacy has grown increasingly close as more and more data protection related issues arise from the use of health data by life sciences companies.</p><p>On the one hand, there are traditional areas of interaction with respect to the processing of personal data in relation to the conduct of clinical trials or the reporting of adverse effects. In that respect, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dataguidance.com/comparisons/general-data-protection-regulation" target="_blank">General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679)</a>&nbsp;('GDPR'), Law No. 2018-493 of 20 June 2018 on the Protection of Personal Data (only available in French&nbsp;<a href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/loda/id/JORFTEXT000037085952/" target="_blank">here</a>) as well as various sets of guidelines published by the <a href="https://www.cnil.fr/" target="_blank">French data protection authority</a> ('CNIL) urge pharmaceutical companies to implement precautionary measures when processing such sensitive data on a day-to-day basis. On the other hand, specific issues relating to health data, such as open-access databases, the aggregation of health data through the national platform,&nbsp;the so-called 'Health data hub' (<a href="https://www.snds.gouv.fr/SNDS/Accueil" target="_blank">Système National des Données de Santé</a>), created by Law No. 2016-41 on the Modernisation of the French Healthcare System (only available in French&nbsp;<a href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/loda/id/JORFTEXT000031912641/" target="_blank">here</a>) ('the Healthcare Modernisation Law'), or the development of connected medical devices or so-called 'quantified self' of life habits tracking technology (tracking data on food consumed, blood oxygen or glucose level, etc.) raise various regulatory concerns. Big Data has penetrated the e-health world and telemedicine has become more than never a hot topic, boosted by COVID-19 pandemic concerns.&nbsp;</p><p>Specific requirements also apply to the hosting activity of personal health related data. Moreover, the processing of health-related data requires strengthened protection as it is considered sensitive personal data. In that respect, particular specificities are provided by the GDPR and French law, which generally impose an additional level of administrative burden on companies processing health related data, in particular with the authorisation procedure of the CNIL for specific data processing activities or the certification procedure of health data hosting providers, the latter being one of the French law specificities in comparison to other European countries.</p><p>The regulatory scope is in constant evolution, and with the increasing regulatory power of the national regulators, compliance is set to remain a work in progress.</p><div name="1.1.Legislation" data-unique="1.1.Legislation"></div><h3><a id="column-1" name="column-1"></a><a id="column-2" name="column-2"></a>1.1. Legislation</h3><p>The French healthcare sector is one of the most heavily regulated and is subject to continuous change. It is driven by European rules which are transposed by national regulation, including the GDPR, which came into force on 25 May 2018 (modifying significant aspects of the legal framework impacting health data related issues) and Act No. 78-17 of 6 January 1978 on Data Processing, Data Files and Individual Liberties (as amended by Law No. 2018-493 of 20 June 2018) (only available in French <a href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/loda/id/JORFTEXT000000886460/" target="_blank">here</a>; an unofficial English version of the Act is available <a href="https://www.dataguidance.com/legal-research/act-no78-17-6-january-1978-information-technology-data-files-and-civil-liberties" target="_blank">here</a>) ('the Data Protection Act').</p><p>Regulation in the pharmaceutical industry mainly derives from the Public Health Code (only available in French <a href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/codes/id/LEGITEXT000006072665/" target="_blank">here</a>) ('the PHC') which contains provisions of French laws transposing the following European directives, for example:</p><ul><li>the requirements and procedures regarding marketing authorisations for medicinal products for human use are primarily laid down in <a href="https://www.dataguidance.com/legal-research/directive-community-code-relating-medicinal-products-human-use-directive-200183ec" target="_blank">Directive 2001/83/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 November 2001 on the Community Code Relating to Medicinal Products for Human Use</a>;</li><li>regarding clinical trials, <a href="https://www.dataguidance.com/legal-research/regulation-eu-no-5362014-16-april-2014-clinical-trials-medicinal-products-human-use" target="_blank">Regulation (EU) 536/2014 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 April 2014 on Clinical Trials on Medicinal Products for Human Use</a> ('the Clinical Trials Regulation') is set to replace <a href="https://www.dataguidance.com/legal-research/directive-relating-implementation-good-clinical-practice-conduct-clinical-trials" target="_blank">Directive 2001/20/EC of 4 April 2001 on the Approximation of the Laws, Regulations and Administrative Provisions of the Member States Relating to the Implementation of Good Clinical Practice in the Conduct of Clinical Trials on Medicinal Products for Human Use</a>.

Guidelines</h3><p>The ANSM has issued guidelines on manufacturing practices, in particular, Part III of the Guide to Good Manufacturing Practices incorporates the Guidelines on the Formalised Risk Assessment to Determine the Appropriate Good Manufacturing Practices for Excipients Used in Medicinal Products for Human Use, dated 19 March 2015 and as amended on 6 May 2019.</p><p>The ANSM has also published specific recommendations on advertising to health care professionals ('HCP') (only available in French <a href="https://ansm.sante.fr/vos-demarches/industriel#collapse-5" target="_blank" class="toc-filter-processed">here</a>) and to the public (only available in French <a href="https://ansm.sante.fr/vos-demarches/industriel#collapse-5" target="_blank" class="toc-filter-processed">here</a>). There are also guidelines issued by industry associations such as the <a href="https://www.leem.org/" target="_blank">French Pharmaceutical Companies Association</a>.</p><p>Moreover, clinical trials should be conducted in accordance with the <a href="https://www.ich.org/index.html" target="_blank">International Conference on Harmonisation</a>'s <a href="https://www.dataguidance.com/legal-research/integrated-addendum-ich-e6r1-guideline-good-clinical-practice-e6r2-2016" target="_blank">Guideline for Good Clinical Practices</a>, which provide unified standards and technical requirements regarding medicinal products for human use.</p><p>In addition, the ANSM's Decision of 24 November 2006 Laying Down the Rules of Good Clinical Practice for Biomedical Research on Medicinal Products for Human Use (only available in French <a href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/jorf/id/JORFTEXT000000819256" target="_blank">here</a>) sets the rules for good clinical practice for clinical trials on medicines for human use as referred to in Article L. 1121-1 of the PHC. Good clinical practices aim to ensure both the reliability of data arising from clinical trials and the protection of the persons participating in these clinical trials.</p><p>Recently, the ANSM has also updated specific guidelines (only available in French <a href="https://ansm.sante.fr/dossiers-thematiques/covid-19-vos-demarches-durant-la-pandemie/covid-19-amm-variations-renouvellement-caducite" target="_blank">here</a>) in relation to research conducted in the emergency context of the COVID-19 pandemic, aimed at applicants and marketing authorisation holders of medicines for human use (available in French <a href="https://www.ansm.sante.fr/Activites/Essais-cliniques/COVID-19-Ongoing-clinical-trials/(offset)/1" target="_blank">here</a>). These guidelines notably state that initiating new clinical trials must be weighed in light of the health emergency, and that priority must be given to trials relating to SARS-CoV-2. The health emergency has also triggered guidelines at EU level. For instance, the European Data Protection Board has published <a href="https://www.dataguidance.com/legal-research/guidelines-032020-processing-data-concerning" target="_blank">Guidelines 03/2020 on the Processing of Data Concerning Health for the Purpose of Scientific Research in the Context of the COVID-19 Outbreak</a>.</p><div name="1.4.Definitions" data-unique="1.4.Definitions"></div><h3>1.4. Definitions</h3><p><strong>Health data</strong>: The GDPR broadly defines health data, as 'personal data related to the physical or mental health of a natural person, including the provision of health care services, which reveal information about that person's health status' (Article 4(15) of the GDPR). This is the first coordinated definition of health data. In addition, Recital 35 specifies that personal data concerning health should include all data pertaining to the health status of a data subject which reveals information relating to the past, current or future physical or mental health status of the data subject.</p><p><strong>Sensitive data</strong>: Under the GDPR, the following personal data, relating to health, is considered as 'sensitive' and is subject to specific processing conditions; genetic data, biometric data processed solely to identify a human being, and health-related data.</p><div name="2.ClinicalResearchandClinicalTrials" data-unique="2.ClinicalResearchandClinicalTrials"></div><h2><a id="column-4" name="column-4"></a>2. Clinical Research and Clinical Trials</h2><div name="2.1.Datacollectionandretention" data-unique="2.1.Datacollectionandretention"></div><h3><a id="column-5" name="column-5"></a>2.1. Data collection and retention</h3><p>The processing of health data shall comply with the GDPR requirements and the Data Protection Act. Health data, genetic and biometric data are considered as sensitive data and should not be processed. Nonetheless, there are some exceptions provided by Article 9 of the GDPR:</p><ul><li>if the data subject has given explicit consent to the processing of personal data for one or more specified purposes;</li><li>if processing is necessary for reasons of public interest in the area of public health; and</li><li>if processing is necessary for the purposes of preventive medicine, for the assessment of the working capacity of the employee, medical diagnosis, social care or treatment or the management of health or social care systems and services.</li></ul><p>In France, prior notification to CNIL in order to process personal data has been abolished in most cases by the Data Protection Act. For instance, there is no prior notification where health data is processed by HCPs for the medical follow-up of patients nor if the data subject has given his/her express consent.</p><p>However, prior formalities for particular categories of processing operations still have to be completed before CNIL. In that respect, the data controller shall file an authorisation to CNIL in the context of the processing of health data for the purpose of public interest or in the context of clinical studies. These processing operations involve the opinion of the <a href="https://www.iledefrance.ars.sante.fr/comites-de-protection-des-personnes-cpp" target="_blank">Committee for the Protection of Individuals</a> if the research involves the human person, and the Ethical and Scientific Committee for Research, Studies and Evaluations in the field of Health ('CESREES'), which succeeded CEREES (the Expert Committee for Research, Studies and Evaluations in the field of Health), if the research does not involve the human person. In the specific context of research on Coronavirus, CNIL has mentioned in a press release (only available in French <a href="https://www.cnil.fr/fr/recherches-sur-le-covid-19-la-cnil-se-mobilise" target="_blank">here</a>) that it would be committed to processing these requests for authorisation as a matter of priority, within short deadlines, in order to accelerate the research process.</p><p>Moreover, there are simplified standards. In particular, CNIL has developed updated reference methodologies, further to the GDPR, such as MR001 for risk intervention research (only available in French <a href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/jorf/id/JORFTEXT000037187386" target="_blank">here</a>) ('MR001') and MR003 for minimal risk and non-interventional research (only available in French <a href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/jorf/id/JORFTEXT000037187443" target="_blank">here</a>) ('MR003') in order to offer a secure framework for the processing of health data in the context of clinical studies, in compliance with GDPR requirements.<br><br>As soon as one of the processing operations complies with a reference methodology developed by CNIL, the processing operation can be conducted without prior authorisation by the CNIL. However, the data controller shall file with CNIL, a compliance undertaking with these reference methodologies and provide a declaration so as to prove such compliance.</p><p>Furthermore, the processing of very sensitive data remains strictly regulated and is subject to an extensive control by CNIL (this is the case for the processing of data containing near-infrared spectroscopy). If the processing operation does not fall under the scope of CNIL's authorisation process (i.e. processing for the purpose of public interest or in the context of clinical studies), such processing shall be subject to an authorisation by decree, following an opinion published by CNIL. Such monitoring is also maintained for several telemedicine activities.</p><div name="2.2.Consent" data-unique="2.2.Consent"></div><h3><a id="column-6" name="column-6"></a>2.2. Consent</h3><p>The processing of health data is possible if the data subject has given explicit consent to the processing for one or more specified purposes. Thus, the data controller must be able to prove that the data subject has given this consent under valid conditions. Pursuant to Article 7 of the GDPR, 'consent' of the data subject means any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject's wishes by which he or she, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her.</p><p><strong>Children's Consent</strong></p><p>There are particular conditions applicable to minors' consent. Pursuant to Article 8 of the GDPR, the processing of children's personal data is lawful where the child is at least 16 years old. Where the child is below the age of 16 years, such processing shall be lawful only if and to the extent that consent is given or authorised by the holder of parental responsibility over the child.</p><p>Member States may provide for a lower age (although not below 13 years old). In France, the Data Protection Act has implemented a minimum age of 15 years old.</p><p><strong>Clinical Trials</strong></p><p>A clinical trial may not be conducted without giving prior information to the data subject and without that individual's prior written consent. Before accepting to participate in a clinical trial, the data subject shall notably be informed by the HCP of the objective, methodology and duration of the research, including expected benefits, foreseeable constraints and risks, possible medical options. In addition, the individual may withdraw his or her consent at any time without being held liable.</p><div name="2.3.Dataobtainedfromthirdparties" data-unique="2.3.Dataobtainedfromthirdparties"></div><h3>2.3. Data obtained from third parties</h3><p>Rules for obtaining data/samples from someone other than the data subject (e.g. public health service provider, hospitals). Privacy notices/ information provision requirements to be included.</p><p>The controller shall provide a series of information to persons whose data are collected indirectly (Article 14 of GDPR). Several information must then be provided by the data controller or his representative, to the person whose data are indirectly processed. For example:</p><ul><li>the identity of the person in charge;</li><li>the purpose of the processing operation;</li><li>the mandatory or optional nature of the answers;</li><li>the possible consequences of a failure to respond;</li><li>the recipients of the data;</li><li>the rights of individuals concerning these data (mainly the right to object, access and rectification); and</li><li>the existence of transfers outside the EU.</li></ul><div name="3.Pharmacovigilance" data-unique="3.Pharmacovigilance"></div><h2><a id="column-7" name="column-7"></a>3. Pharmacovigilance</h2><p>Under French law, pharmacovigilance is defined as the procedures which intend to monitor, evaluate, prevent and manage the risk of an adverse reaction resulting from the use of medicinal products (Article L5121-22 of the PHC). Pharmacovigilance involves the reporting of suspected medicinal product-related adverse reactions, including in case of overdose, misuse, abuse and medication errors (Article R5121-151 of the PHC). The list of medicinal products subject to the reporting is mentioned under Article R5121-150 of the PHC.&nbsp;</p><p>Pharmacovigilance is coordinated between the ANSM, regional pharmacovigilance centres, HCPs and pharmaceutical companies. The latter have an obligation to collect and assess information relating to adverse effects, with a view to prevent and mitigate risks and must, if necessary, take appropriate measures.</p><p>Concerning the data protection related issues with respect to pharmacovigilance, it is noteworthy that pursuant to the requirements of good pharmacovigilance practices as updated by the ANSM on 2 February 2018 (only available in French <a href="https://ansm.sante.fr/uploads/2020/10/26/20200914-bppv-fevrier-2018.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>), organisations have to use an automated data processing system in relation with their pharmacovigilance system.</p><p>Therefore, organisations must collect and process personal data in compliance with their pharmacovigilance obligations. In that respect, CNIL published on 18 July 2019 its standard relating to the processing of personal data for the purpose of managing health vigilance systems such as pharmacovigilance (only available in French <a href="https://www.cnil.fr/sites/default/files/atoms/files/referentiel_vigilances_sanitaires.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>) ('the Standard'), which replaced its Unique Authorisation (only available in French <a href="https://www.cnil.fr/fr/declaration/pdf/14476" target="_blank">here</a>) ('AU-013') on data processing operations related to pharmacovigilance. If the data processing meets the requirements set forth by the CNIL in the Standard, the company shall only file a declaration of conformity with the CNIL (only available in French <a href="https://declarations.cnil.fr/declarations/declaration/declarant.display.action;jsessionid=40821D9D409449666D848B0579831719" target="_blank">here</a>); otherwise it shall file an application for an authorisation (only available in French <a href="https://declarations.cnil.fr/declarations/declaration/brouillon.action?declarationType=DT" target="_blank">here</a>).</p><p>Finally, according to the Order of 27 February 2017 as amended on 30 October 2017, relating to the Automated Processing of Personal Data through a portal Called "Portal For Reporting Adverse Health Events" (only available in French <a href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/loda/id/JORFTEXT000034150842/" target="_blank">here</a>). The online portal (only available in French <a href="https://signalement.social-sante.gouv.fr/psig_ihm_utilisateurs/index.html#/accueil" target="_blank" class="toc-filter-processed">here</a>) has been available since 13 March 2017 and is aimed at facilitating the reporting of adverse reactions related to medicinal products by companies, healthcare practitioners and patients. The personal information which is required to be filled in the online form to report adverse reactions are essentially the name, healthcare practitioner registration number, email address, the name of the involved drug, the nature of the adverse reaction, as well as the age, gender and postal code of the concerned subject. There has been criticisms concerning the fact that the data related to the batch numbers, the date of the treatment initiation, the cause of the prescription or absorbed dose do not need to be mandatorily filled.</p><div name="4.Biobanking" data-unique="4.Biobanking"></div><h2><a id="column-8" name="column-8"></a>4. Biobanking</h2><p>'Biobanks' do not have any legal definition under French law, however they are generally known as a 'centre in which biological sample collections are stored.' The management of biobanks generally involves computerised databases in order to classify the samples, to easily identify the origin of the samples, as well as to have access to all relevant information on a concerned subject or disease.</p><p>The conservation of human biological samples in biobanks for therapeutic or scientific purposes is subject to specific rules regarding required authorisations to obtain and declarations to file.</p><p>Firstly, the PHC imposes the following formalities regarding biobank activities under Articles L.1243-2 to L.1243-4:</p><ul><li>authorisation by the ANSM upon opinion of the <a href="https://www.agence-biomedecine.fr/?lang=fr" target="_blank">French Biomedicine Agency</a> for the storage of samples for autologous or allogeneic therapeutic purposes;</li><li>prior declaration to the <a href="https://www.enseignementsup-recherche.gouv.fr/" target="_blank">French Ministry of Higher Education, Research and Innovation</a> ('the Ministry') for the storage of biological samples for the needs of its own research programs; and</li><li>authorisation by the Ministry for the storage of biological samples with a view to transfer them for scientific use.</li></ul><p>Secondly, regarding the data protection related aspects in relation with activities of biobanks, the data controller (i.e. the biobank) has to obtain the following:</p><ul><li>authorisation upon opinion of the competent Committee for the Protection of Humans for research and studies involving humans, or upon opinion of the Expert Committee for Research for research or studies not involving humans; and</li><li>authorisation for activities where sensitive data are processed for the purpose of public interest or in the context of clinical studies, however, prior authorisation is not required if the processing operations comply with MR001 or MR003. In those cases, the data controller shall file an online declaration in order to prove its compliance.</li></ul><div name="5.DataManagement" data-unique="5.DataManagement"></div><h2><a id="column-9" name="column-9"></a>5. Data Management</h2><p>The GDPR triggers the abolishment of pre-processing formalities obligations on the data controller and gives way to the accountability of the data controller. Indeed, since the implementation of the GDPR, companies have to define their own internal policies in the field of personal data protection. In particular, the principle of 'accountability' implies that the controller must be able to demonstrate, at any time, his compliance with the requirements of the GDPR by documenting all security and organisational measures taken. However, it should be noted that prior formalities are maintained for some kinds of processing operations (see the section on Data collection and retention above).</p><p>The controller and its representative have to record processing activities which are under their responsibility. This register includes a general description of the implemented technical security and organisational measures. Please note that this obligation also extends to processors. Moreover, where processing of health data is likely to create a 'high risk' to the rights and freedoms of individuals, the data controller must carry out a Data Protection Impact Assessment before data is processed.&nbsp;</p><p>The data controller is required to take all necessary precautions regarding the nature of the data and the risks of the processing to preserve data integrity and security, as well as to prevent them from being distorted, damaged or accessed by unauthorised third-parties. The security requirements will increase with the degree of data sensitivity, such as health data. For example, CNIL recommends the implementation of safe connection logging methods in that respect.</p><p>Concerning health data, anonymisation and pseudonymisation of data are also security measures to be implemented, and the same are recommended by CNIL. For instance, CNIL recommends the anonymisation of data in the context of the mandatory reporting of certain infectious diseases by HCPs, as anonymisation is an irreversible process that does not allow any direct or indirect identification of data subjects.&nbsp;</p><div name="6.Outsourcing" data-unique="6.Outsourcing"></div><h2><a id="column-10" name="column-10"></a>6. Outsourcing</h2><p>In the context of clinical trials, 'sponsors' may sign agreements with other contracting parties, such as Contract Research Organisations ('CROs'). The processing of personal data collected during the clinical trial must be made in accordance with organisational and security measures at any time.</p><p>Most of the time, the sponsor in this case is the data controller, as the sponsor defines the means and purposes of data processing. Data processing agreements may also be concluded between sponsors and CROs in that respect. It should be noted in some cases, that a contracting party (such as a CRO), can also define the purposes and means of processing and therefore the qualification of joint data controllers. Sponsors and CROs must both comply with data protection principles (see the section on Data Management above).</p><div name="7.DataTransfers" data-unique="7.DataTransfers"></div><h2><a id="column-11" name="column-11"></a>7. Data Transfers</h2><p>There are specific rules provided by the GDPR with respect to the transfer of personal data outside of the EU. These rules also apply to the transfer of sensitive personal data.</p><p>As a general rule, the data controller may not transfer personal data outside the EU to a jurisdiction that does not provide a sufficient level of the protection of personal data. The <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/index_en" target="_blank">European Commission</a> has so far recognised Andorra, Argentina, Canada, Switzerland, Faeroe Islands, Guernsey, Israel, the Isle of Man, Jersey, New Zealand, Japan, and Uruguay as providing an 'adequate' level of protection.</p><p>If the data controller wishes to transfer personal data to countries which are not considered by the European Commission as ensuring an adequate level of data protection, the data controller would have to ensure that adequate safeguards are implemented.</p><p>There are different options set forth in the GDPR in order to ensure an adequate level of compliance which including the following legal tools:</p><ul><li>Binding Corporate Rules: a code of practice for intragroup transfers.</li><li>EU model clauses ('Standard Contractual Clauses' or 'SCC') incorporated within a data transfer agreement, which are standard contractual clauses that are easier to implement and appropriate for all data transfers outside of the EU. Further to the invalidation of the <a href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/welcome" target="_blank">EU-US Privacy Shield</a> (a self-certification from the EU to the US) by the <a href="https://curia.europa.eu/jcms/jcms/j_6/en/" target="_blank">Court of Justice of the European Union</a> in July 2020 through <em>Data Protection Commissioner v. Facebook Ireland Limited, Maximillian Schrems (C-311/18)</em> ('the Schrems II Case'), the European Commission has published in June 2021 <a href="https://www.dataguidance.com/advisories/schrems-ii" target="_blank">updated SCCs to be used by data controllers</a>.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>On top of these general rules, CNIL also provides specific rules regarding the personal data processed within the MR001 and MR003 frameworks; only anonymised data or indirectly identifying data (encoded or pseudonymised data) of data subjects participating in the studies can be transferred outside of the EU.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, in France, there has been a judicial debate concerning the possibility to rely on US based data hosts in order to host health personal data, due to the risks that US surveillance laws might pose to data subjects in the event of access requests by US agencies. Two noteworthy decisions were rendered by the <a href="https://www.conseil-etat.fr/" target="_blank">French Council of State</a>, which is the highest French administrative court, on this issue. First, on 13 October 2020, the Council of State moderated the CNIL's position by refusing to suspend the operation of the hosting of the French data hub. Second, on 12 March 2021, the Council of State rendered a second decision allowing Doctolib, a company in charge of booking COVID-19 vaccination appointments, to rely on a subsidiary of an U.S.-based health data host.</p><div name="8.BreachNotification" data-unique="8.BreachNotification"></div><h2><a id="column-12" name="column-12"></a>8. Breach Notification</h2><p>The data controller must ensure the security and confidentiality of the personal data processed through the implementation of measures so as to prevent data breaches and react appropriately in the detection of a data security breach. It is important to ensure, through initial investigations, that a data breach had occurred and to determine the seriousness of the breach.</p><p>The nature and cause of the incident must therefore be suspected or proven so as to determine if notification to the supervisory authority is required. If the notification obligation is triggered, it must be made as soon as possible, and at the latest, 72 hours after the data controller had become aware of it. In practice, the starting point of this period is when the controller has a reasonable degree of conviction that an incident has occurred and has affected personal data. Such ability implies that the data controller has put in place measures to detect violations and that they conduct investigations as soon as possible, to achieve such reasonable certainty.</p><p>Moreover, the GDPR requires notification to the data subjects if the breach is 'likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons' (Article 34 of the GDPR). There are, however, exceptions to the notification to data subjects, notably when the data controller has taken further measures to ensure that the high risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals is no longer likely to occur. If such notification is required, it must at least contain and explain:</p><ul><li>the nature of the violation;</li><li>the consequences of the violation;</li><li>the contact details of the person to contact (data protection officer or other); and</li><li>the measures taken to remedy the violation.</li></ul><div name="9.DataSubjectRights" data-unique="9.DataSubjectRights"></div><h2>9.

Concerning the latter certification, Ordinance No. 2017-27 of 12 January 2017 Relating to Personal Health Data Hosting (only available in French <a href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/loda/id/JORFTEXT000033860770/" target="_blank">here</a>) clarifies the modalities of the new certification procedure, which will be issued by Cofrac accreditation bodies.</p><p><strong>The Hosting Decree</strong></p><p>The implementing Decree No. 2018-137 of 26 February 2018 Relative to the Hosting of Personal Health Data (only available in French <a href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/jorf/id/JORFTEXT000036650041?r=vM5hclZiiG" target="_blank">here</a>) ('the Hosting Decree') sets out the rules regarding the hosting of personal health data. A health data hosting company should select a certifying body accredited by Cofrac (or its equivalent at European level) in accordance with the accreditation standard.
