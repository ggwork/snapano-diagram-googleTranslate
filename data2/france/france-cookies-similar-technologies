DEFINITIONS</h2><p><strong>Cookies &amp; similar technologies:&nbsp;</strong>There is no definition of 'cookies and similar technologies' in the law. However, the Guidelines apply to the use of HTTP cookies as well as, among others, 'local shared objects,' sometimes called 'flash cookies,' 'local storage' implemented within HTML 5, identifications by calculating the terminal's footprint, identifiers generated by operating systems (whether advertising or not), and hardware identifiers (MAC address, serial number, or any other identifier of a device) (Article 1 of the Guidelines). Please note that both the Guidelines and the Recommendations refer to both the web and mobile environment, as well as both to logged and non-logged environments (Sections 6 and 7 of the Recommendations).</p><p>Furthermore, the Cookie Alternatives Guidance outlines that the ePrivacy Directive and Article 82 of the Act are applicable to alternative technologies developed for targeted advertising, including:</p><ul><li>first-party cookies and browser fingerprinting;</li><li>single sign-on;</li><li>unique identifiers; and</li><li>cohort-based targeting advertising.</li></ul><p><strong>Consent: </strong>Any freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject's wishes by which they, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the processing of personal data relating to them (Article 4(11) and Recital 94 of the GDPR).</p><p><strong>Personal data:</strong> Any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person ('data subject'); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person (Article 4(1) of the GDPR).</p><p><strong>Data processing: </strong>Any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction<strong> (</strong>Article 4(2) of the GDPR).</p><p><strong>Online identifiers:</strong> Natural persons may be associated with online identifiers provided by their devices, applications, tools and protocols, such as internet protocol addresses, cookie identifiers or other identifiers such as radio frequency identification tags. This may leave traces which, in particular when combined with unique identifiers and other information received by the servers, may be used to create profiles of the natural persons and identify them (Recital 30 of the GDPR).</p><p><strong>Terminal equipment:&nbsp;</strong>There is<strong> </strong>no applicable definition of 'terminal equipment' under the Act.</p><div name="3.CONSENTMANAGEMENT" data-unique="3.CONSENTMANAGEMENT"></div><h2><a id="column-3" name="column-3"></a>3. CONSENT MANAGEMENT</h2><div name="3.1.Isconsentrequired?" data-unique="3.1.Isconsentrequired?"></div><h3>3.1. Is consent required?</h3><p>Prior consent is required for the storing of information or the gaining of access to information already stored in the terminal equipment of a subscriber or user, and the individual must be offered the right to refuse such processing by the data controller (Article 5(3) of the ePrivacy Directive and paragraph 40 of the Opinion).</p><p>Article 82 of the Act implements Article 5(3) of the ePrivacy Directive into French law and provides that any subscriber or user of an electronic communication service will be informed in a clear and comprehensive manner by the controller or their representative, except if previously notified, regarding (Article 82 of the Act):</p><ul><li>the purpose of any action intended to provide access, electronically, to information previously stored in their electronic connection terminal device, or to record data on this device; and</li><li>the means available to them to object to such action.</li></ul><p>Such access or recording may only be carried out provided that the subscriber or user has explicitly expressed, after receiving said information, their consent, which may result from appropriate parameter settings on their connection device or any other system under their control (Article 82 of the Act).</p><div name="3.2.Conditionsforvalidconsent" data-unique="3.2.Conditionsforvalidconsent"></div><h3>3.2. Conditions for valid consent</h3><p>The Opinion clarifies that Article 2(f) of the ePrivacy Directive states that 'consent' by a user or subscriber corresponds to the data subject's consent in [the GDPR]' (paragraph 14 of the Opinion).</p><p>The conditions for valid consent are outlined in Article 4(11) of the GDPR and consist of the following elements:</p><ul><li>freely given;</li><li>specific;</li><li>informed; and</li><li>unambiguous indication of the data subject's wishes by which they, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the processing of personal data relating to them.</li></ul><p>The Consent Guidelines provide detailed guidance on each element of valid consent. Notably, the Consent Guidelines emphasise that 'clear affirmative act' means that the data subject must have taken a deliberate action to consent to the particular processing (paragraph 77 of the Consent Guidelines). Hence, the use of pre-ticked opt-in boxes is invalid under the GDPR. Furthermore, silence or inactivity on the part of the data subject, as well as merely proceeding with a service cannot be regarded as an active indication of choice (paragraph 79 of the Consent Guidelines). Moreover, merely continuing the ordinary use of a website is not sufficient to constitute indication of wishes by which the data subject signifies their agreement to a proposed processing operation (paragraph 84 of the Consent Guidelines).</p><p>The EDPB further highlights that controllers must ensure that data subjects can withdraw consent as easily as giving consent and at any given time (Article 7(3) of the GDPR and paragraph 113 of the Consent Guidelines).</p><p>The Guidelines reiterate that consent must conform with the definition and conditions of Articles 4(11) and 7 of the GDPR (Sections 16 to 31 of the Guidelines).</p><p>Trackers requiring consent may not be used until the user has consented to the same in a freely-given, specific, informed, and unambiguous way, which may be through a declaration or through a clearly positive act (Sections 17 to 28 of the Guidelines).</p><p>Consent can only be valid if the individual concerned is presented with a valid opportunity to express their choice. The individual should not be majorly inconvenienced if consent is absent or retracted (Sections 30 to 31 of the Guidelines).</p><div name="3.3.Analyticsandaudiencemeasurementcookies" data-unique="3.3.Analyticsandaudiencemeasurementcookies"></div><h3>3.3. Analytics and audience measurement cookies</h3><p>Consent may not be required for the use of cookies and other trackers in the context of measuring audiences if (Article 5 of the Guidelines, Sections 49 and 50 of the Recommendations, and the Audience Measurement Guidance):</p><ul><li>the individual has been informed prior to their use via the privacy policy of the site of the mobile application; and</li><li>the purposes of processing are limited to what is strictly necessary for:<ul><li>measuring the audience for the purposes of evaluating published content and site ergonomics;</li><li>producing anonymous statistical data;</li><li>the optimisation of the use of the website; or</li><li>general modification of a website. However, data controllers must not combine personal data which has been collected or transfer such data to third parties. The use of trackers should be limited to the production of anonymous statistics and should only be accessed by one assigned website or app developer.</li></ul></li></ul><p>In addition, CNIL recommends that for audience measurement cookies and trackers (the Audience Measurement Guidance):</p><ul><li>the lifespan of the cookies and trackers should be limited in duration in a way that allows a relevant comparison of audiences over time, as in the case of a 13 months duration, and cookies' lifespan must not be extended with every new visit;</li><li>the information collected through these cookies and trackers should be retained for a maximum period of 25 months;</li><li>the lifespan and retention periods should be periodically reviewed to ensure that their duration is limited to what is strictly necessary; and</li><li>while it is possible for sub-processors to provide a comparative audience measurement service to several content publishers, the data must be collected, processed, and stored independently for each publisher and the trackers must be independent of each other.</li></ul><p>CNIL reminds that in practice some audience measurement mechanisms do not fall within the consent exemption, especially when the technology supplier reuses collected data for its own purposes, such as in the case of the major audience measurement technology providers on the market. In this case, it may be possible to configure the tool in order to deactivate the reuse of data, and CNIL recommends organisations to check with the supplier whether the same is contractually committed not to reuse the data collected (the Audience Measurement Guidance).</p><div name="3.4.Exemptions" data-unique="3.4.Exemptions"></div><h3>3.4. Exemptions</h3><p>Consent is not required for cookies which are strictly necessary in order to provide an information society service explicitly requested by the subscriber or user (Article 5(3) of the ePrivacy Directive). Furthermore, consent is not required for cookies used for the sole purpose of carrying out or facilitating the transmission of a communication over an electronic communications network (Article 5(3) of the ePrivacy Directive).</p><p>Consent and transparency requirements prescribed by Article 82 of the Law will not apply if the access to data stored on the terminal device of the user or the recording of information on the terminal device of the user is (Article 82 of the Act):</p><ul><li>either exclusively intended to enable or facilitate communication by electronic means; or</li><li>is strictly necessary for the provision of an online communication service at the user's express request.</li></ul><p>The use of trackers to measure the audience of a website or application, or to test different versions in order to better inform design choices or detect navigation problems, are strictly necessary for the administration of a website or an app. Therefore, organisations do not need to obtain consent for such activities (Section 49 of the Guidelines).</p><p>However, CNIL reminds that strictly necessary cookies stored without the user's consent cannot be used for different purposes, such as advertising, without the user's explicit consent (Section 48 of the Recommendations).</p><p>CNIL notes that some of the types of trackers that are considered exempt from the requirement of consent are (Section 49 of the Guidelines):</p><ul><li>trackers used for the purposes of authentication, including those used to ensure the security of the authentication procedure, such as those used for limiting access by robots;</li><li>trackers used for personalisation of a user interface;</li><li>trackers used in for-payment websites to limit the free access to the use the website; and</li><li>some trackers used for the purposes of audience measurement.</li></ul><p>Further, trackers used for the transmission of invoices regarding membership are not exempt from the requirement to obtain consumer consent for the same since such processing do not have the exclusive purposes of allowing or facilitating electronic communications and are not strictly necessary for the provision of a communication service as requested by the user (Question 12 of the FAQs).</p><p>Lastly, although consumers do not need to be informed of the use of functional cookies under the Act, CNIL nevertheless recommends this as part of respecting the principle of transparency and suggests that the cookie policy contain this information (Question 14 of the FAQs).</p><div name="3.5.Cookieinformationrequirements" data-unique="3.5.Cookieinformationrequirements"></div><h3>3.5. Cookie information requirements</h3><p>Pursuant to Article 5(3) of the ePrivacy Directive, user consent to cookies is conditional on the provision of clear and comprehensive information, in accordance with the GDPR, <em>inter alia</em>, about the purposes of the processing.</p><p>The Consent Guidelines further outline that for consent to be informed in accordance with the GDPR, it is necessary to inform the data subject of certain elements that are crucial to make a choice, noting that at least the following information is required for obtaining valid consent (paragraph 64 of the Consent Guidelines):</p><ul><li>the controller's identity;</li><li>the purpose of each of the processing operations for which consent is sought;</li><li>what (type of) data will be collected and used;</li><li>the existence of the right to withdraw consent;</li><li>information about the use of the data for automated decision-making in accordance with Article 22(2)(c) of the GDPR where relevant; and</li><li>on the possible risks of data transfers due to absence of an adequacy decision and of appropriate safeguards as described in Article 46 of the GDPR.</li></ul><p>In the specific context of cookies, the Guidelines provide that the user should be informed of at least the following (Section 24 of the Guidelines):</p><ul><li>the identity of the data controller or data processor;</li><li>the purpose of the processing;</li><li>the manner of accepting or refusing trackers;</li><li>the consequences of refusing or accepting the use of trackers; and</li><li>the existence of the right to withdraw consent.</li></ul><p>The user must be able to identify any parties having access to such trackers before giving consent. The list of the same must be exhaustive, regularly updated, and available to the user directly when consent is obtained (Section 25 of the Guidelines).</p><p>Information provided to the data subject when requesting consent must be complete, visible, and highlighted. It is insufficient to feature as a short comment in the terms and conditions of use (Section 23 of the Guidelines).</p><p>Moreover, data subjects must be informed in language that is simple and understandable by all, without overly complex legal or technical terminology. The cookie policy must also allow users to be informed of all purposes for which the trackers will be used (Section 22 of the Guidelines). More specifically, the Recommendations provide that one of the ways of providing information in the first layer on the purposes for which cookies or other trackers will be used would be a short and prominent title, followed by a brief description. CNIL provides some practical examples on the same (Section 13 of the Recommendations).</p><p>In addition, for the purposes of ensuring transparency, CNIL recommends that the names of the trackers be explicit and that convey their origin. In addition, CNIL suggests that professionals use a tracker allowing the saving of users' choices also attaching to each purpose a 'true', 'false' box to memorise the choices made (Section 54 of the Recommendations).</p><div name="3.6.Cookieconsentmechanism" data-unique="3.6.Cookieconsentmechanism"></div><h3>3.6. Cookie consent mechanism&nbsp;</h3><p>The EDPB recommends the use of granularity, noting that consent mechanisms must not only be granular to meet the requirement of 'free', but also to meet the element of 'specific', meaning that a controller that seeks consent for various different purposes should provide a separate opt-in for each purpose, to allow users to give specific consent for specific purposes (paragraph 60 of the Consent Guidelines).</p><p>Whilst reiterating the above point, the Recommendations further highlight that as long as the users are informed about all of the purposes pursued, it is possible to ask users to give their 'global' consent for all the purposes through the use of 'I accept all' and 'I don't accept' buttons (Sections 25 to 27 of the Recommendations). In all cases, it is recommended to use a descriptive interface allowing users to have knowledge of the possibility of giving consent in accordance with the different purposes (Section 29 of the Recommendations).</p><p>Furthermore, the EDPB highlights that requests for consent should not be unnecessarily disruptive to the use of the service for which the consent is provided (paragraph 82 of the Consent Guidelines).</p><p>Consent must result from a positive action from individuals who have been informed of the consequences of their choice and of the ways in which they can express consent, for instance by clicking on an 'accept all' button. The absence of such manifestation of acceptance to the use of cookies, as well as any inaction or action other than a positive one, must be understood as a refusal (Section 9 of the Recommendations). Continued navigation of an application or website or pre-ticked boxes does not constitute valid consent (Section 27 of the Guidelines and the FAQs).</p><p>In addition, CNIL recommends that, in cases where the refusal to cookies can be demonstrated through continued navigation on the website, the message asking for consent (either in the form of a window or a banner) should disappear after a short period of time in order to not interfere with the use of the website or the application. In addition, the user's comfort in navigating the website should not depend on the expression of consent to the use of cookies (Section 36 of the Recommendations).</p><p>It must be as easy to give consent as it is to withdraw it and as such mechanisms must be in place to ensure the same. Individuals who have given their consent to the use of trackers should be capable of withdrawing it at any given time (Sections 30 to 31 of the Guidelines). Moreover, it should be noted that the Conseil d'Etat Decision upheld the Guidelines provision that individuals should be able to withdraw consent as easily as they give it. In addition, the Recommendations provide that the interface enabling users to withdraw their consent must be available at all times, for instance through the use of a link that is accessible at any time. In addition, website operators can provide users, through a cookie icon, with access to a cookie configuration module where they will be able to manage and/or withdraw their consent (Section 43 of the Recommendations). With regards to the design of the tool used to manage or withdraw consent, CNIL recommends that it must be located in an area which attracts the attention of users and that the visuals used must be as explicit as possible (Section 44 of the Recommendation).</p><p>A 'Refuse all' button, or a similar solution which allows refusal to the placement of cookies as easily as acceptance, must be available within the same layer as the 'Accept all' button. CNIL considers that the implementation of a 'Refuse all' button in such a position, in the same visual space as the 'Accept all' button, constitutes a clear manner in which the user can communicate their choice (Question 30 of the FAQs).</p><p>The choice not to consent to the placement of cookies or other trackers cannot take place on the second layer of information, for example via 'Manage your preferences,' even where the user is explicitly informed of this. CNIL reiterates that the tool for refusal of cookies should be available on the same screen and with the same functionality as the tool which permits acceptance of cookies. Specifically, CNIL considers that the functionality of being able to consent to cookies in a single click, in comparison to multiple actions being required in order to generate a refusal, for example through preference management, tends to influence the choice of the user, who simply wants to access the website or app as quickly as possible (Question 31 of the FAQs).</p><p>Data controllers must also prove that they have obtained users' valid consent (Section 29 of the Guidelines). This can be achieved by (Section 48 of the Recommendations):</p><ul><li>keeping a screenshot of the visual displayed on the mobile phone or the web browser in a time-stamped manner for each version of the website or the application;</li><li>regular audits of consent collection methods in the website or application, which may also be put in place by third parties responsible for consent collection from the website or application concerned;</li><li>information on the tools and configurations (such as consent management solutions or consent management platforms) being kept in a time-stamped manner by the third parties responsible for editing these tools; or</li><li>the different versions of the code used by organisations collecting consent can be handed to a third party or a hash code version can be published on a public platform in a time-stamped manner for the purposes of proving its authenticity.</li></ul><div name="3.7.Cookiewalls" data-unique="3.7.Cookiewalls"></div><h3>3.7. Cookie walls</h3><p>According to the EDPB, consent is not considered to be freely given if access to services and functionalities are made conditional on the consent of a user to the storing of information, or gaining of access to information already stored, in the terminal equipment of a user, i.e. cookie walls (paragraph 39 of the Consent Guidelines).</p><p>Following the Conseil d'Etat Decision, the fourth paragraph of Article 2 of the old Guidelines and, thus, the prohibition of cookie walls, has been annulled. More specifically, the Conseil d'Etat Decision established that CNIL exceeded its legal powers, by introducing, in the context of a flexible legal instrument such as the old Guidelines, a blanket prohibition of cookie walls based on the principle of free consent to the use of cookies.</p><p>Therefore, under the Guidelines, cookie walls are not banned. In fact, while the Guidelines provide that subjecting the use of a service or the access to a website to the acceptance of cookies or trackers (i.e. the use of 'cookie walls') may undermine the freedom of users to consent, the lawfulness of cookie walls has to be determined on a case by case basis. In practice, if a cookie wall is set up, and subject to the lawfulness of this practice, the information provided to users must clearly indicate the consequences of their choice, with specific reference to the impossibility to access the content or service if consent is not provided (Sections 17 to 18 of the Guidelines).</p><p>Further to the above, in the Cookie Wall Guidance, issued on 31 May 2021, CNIL explained that an online press publisher conditioning access to its content, either on the acceptance of advertising cookies contributing to remunerate its service, or on the payment of a sum reasonable money, is not prohibited in principle, if the latter allows access to an equivalent version of the site in terms of content and totally devoid of advertising trackers. In addition, CNIL highlighted that other factors, such as the dominant market position of a website, may lead to certain cookie walls being considered unlawful.</p><div name="3.8.Consentduration" data-unique="3.8.Consentduration"></div><h3>3.8. Consent duration</h3><p>The EDPB recommends, as a best practice, that consent should be refreshed at appropriate intervals, further highlighting that providing all the information again helps to ensure the data subject remains well informed about how their data is being used and how to exercise their rights (paragraph 111 of the Consent Guidelines).</p><p>With regards to the re-collection of consent, CNIL recommends that the choice of the users should be registered and the duration for which this choice is retained, without asking for new consent, will be determined on a case-by-case basis. In addition, CNIL notes that data controllers are encouraged to re-collect consent regularly (Sections 37 to 38 of the Recommendations).</p><div name="4.COOKIES&amp;THIRDPARTIES" data-unique="4.COOKIES&amp;THIRDPARTIES"></div><h2><a id="column-4" name="column-4"></a>4. COOKIES &amp; THIRD PARTIES</h2><div name="4.1.Conditionsforplacementofthird-partycookies" data-unique="4.1.Conditionsforplacementofthird-partycookies"></div><h3>4.1. Conditions for placement of third-party cookies</h3><p>The information on consent and transparency requirements with respect to cookie placement outlined in section 3 above apply, in addition to the information below and the information highlighted in section 4.2. below.</p><p><strong>Social media plug-ins</strong></p><p>Social media plug-ins allow third parties to place or access trackers on the user's terminal equipment for purposes other than use of the relevant social media. Such additional purposes might include advertising. In such cases, CNIL confirmed that Article 82 of the Act applies and, as such, the user's consent is required (Question 18 of the FAQs).</p><p><strong>'CNAME cloaking'</strong></p><p>The disguise of subdomains or third-party trackers for the purposes of using cookies does not necessarily contradict data protection law. However, CNIL purports that it is necessary to respect requirements for consent, where applicable, and information of the data subject, for example of the identity of respective data controller for relevant processing activities. To this end, CNIL warns of potential data security threats when engaging with third parties, if the exchanges are poorly managed (Question 25 of the FAQs).</p><div name="4.2.Rolesandresponsibilities" data-unique="4.2.Rolesandresponsibilities"></div><h3>4.2. Roles and responsibilities</h3><p>It should be noted that third parties using cookies and trackers on the website or app of another organisation are considered data controllers and organisations authorising the placement of third-party trackers should ensure that there is a procedure in place to obtain users' consent. CNIL also considers that the publisher, having a direct contact with the user, represents the subject who is most able to provides the user with information and obtain consent. In addition, the publisher of the website and the third party placing trackers on the website can be considered as joint controllers to the extent that they jointly determine the purposes and the means of reading and writing in the user's terminal equipment. In this case they will have to establish their respective obligations under Article 26 of the GDPR, with specific reference to the collection and proof of consent (Sections 34 to 39 of the Guidelines).</p><p>In addition, a company collecting or accessing information stored in the terminal equipment exclusively on behalf of a third party can be considered data processor. Therefore, a contract specifying the obligations of each party must be in place, in accordance with Article 28 of the GDPR. The processor must facilitate the controller's compliance with data protection obligations and inform them in cases where one of the instructions of the data controller constitutes a violation of data protection law (Sections 40 to 42 of the Guidelines).</p><p>Organisations using trackers must put in place mechanisms which allows them to demonstrate, at any time, that they had obtained valid consent from users. In the event that organisations have not obtained consent from users themselves, the requirement for valid consent is not fulfilled by a contractual clause which engages a third-party to obtain consent on their behalf. CNIL recommends that such a contractual clause should be amended to also specify that the subject collecting consent must make available to other parties proof of said consent, so that each controller wishing to benefit from the consent can prove it (Section 47 of the Recommendations).</p><p>In addition, CNIL provides that, in the case of third party cookies allowing the user to navigate beyond the website/app on which they are initially installed, it is strongly recommended to obtain consent for each website/app visited by the user, so that the latter can be entirely aware of the scope of the consent they provided (Section 17 of the Recommendations).</p><p>In certain cases, the use of trackers relates fully to one single entity which is therefore wholly responsible for obtaining consent. However, if multiple parties take part in the processing activities, the parties could be considered as either data controllers, joint controllers, or data processors (Sections 32 to 42 of the Guidelines).</p><p>In some cases, third parties using trackers will be fully and independently responsible for the trackers they use, which means that they assume full responsibility for obtaining user consent. Joint controllers should clearly and transparently define their respective responsibilities to ensure full compliance with Article 26 of the GDPR (Section 39 of the Guidelines).</p><p>Parties who access information stored in a user's terminal equipment on behalf of the data controller without re-using the data for their own purposes will be considered as processors. The data processor and data controller must establish a contract which clarifies their respective responsibilities under Article 28 of the GDPR (Section 40 of the Guidelines).</p><div name="4.3.Internationaldatatransfers" data-unique="4.3.Internationaldatatransfers"></div><h3>4.3. International data transfers</h3><p>The EDPB's <a href="https://www.dataguidance.com/legal-research/guidelines-052021-interplay-between" target="_blank">Guidelines 05/2021 on the Interplay between the application of Article 3 and the provisions on international transfers as per Chapter V of the GDPR</a> identify the following three cumulative criteria for defining as international data transfer:</p><ul><li>controller or a processor is subject to the GDPR for the given processing;</li><li>this controller or processor (i.e. the exporter) discloses by transmission or otherwise makes personal data, subject to this processing, available to another controller, joint controller, or processor (i.e. the data importer); and</li><li>the importer is in a third country or is an international organisation, irrespective of whether or not this importer is subject to the GDPR in respect of the given processing in accordance with Article 3.</li></ul><p>Data processing operations which satisfy the above criteria are subject to Chapter V of the GDPR and, in the absence of an adequacy decision under Article 45 of the GDPR or applicable derogation under Article &nbsp;49 of the GDPR, must be subject to an appropriate safeguard under Article 46 of the GDPR, in accordance with the <a href="https://curia.europa.eu/jcms/jcms/j_6/en/" target="_blank">Court of Justice of the European Union</a>'s ('CJEU') judgment in <a href="https://www.dataguidance.com/legal-research/data-protection-commissioner-v-facebook-ireland-limited-maximillian-schrems-c-31118" target="_blank"><em>Data Protection Commissioner v.

COOKIE RETENTION</h2><p>Trackers used for the purposes of audience measurement must not have a lifespan exceeding 13 months and this period must not be automatically prolonged. Information collected by the above trackers may be retained for a maximum period of 25 months (Section 50 of the Recommendations and the Audience Measurement Guidance).</p><p>In addition, CNIL recommends as a good practice to retain users' choice, both consent or refusal to cookies, for six months (Section 39 of the Recommendations).</p><p>In any case, CNIL recommends that the lifespan and retention period of cookies should be subject to periodic review (Section 50 of the Recommendations).</p><div name="6.ADDITIONALINFORMATION" data-unique="6.ADDITIONALINFORMATION"></div><h2><a id="column-6" name="column-6"></a>6. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION</h2><p><strong>Browser settings</strong></p><p>Article 82 of the Act provides that consent may result from appropriate browser settings on a device belonging to the user. However, browser settings cannot, according to the current state of art, allow the user to express valid consent (Sections 44 to 45 of the Guidelines).</p><p>If browsers do not allow the user to distinguish between cookies with different purposes, the user will not be able to consent to each purpose (Sections 44 to 45 of the Guidelines).</p><p><strong>Legitimate interest as a legal basis</strong></p><p>On the use of legitimate interest as the legal basis for processing personal data collected from trackers, CNIL responds in two parts. Firstly, regarding the placement of or access to cookies on user terminal equipment, Article 82 of the Act and its consent requirements apply. Secondly, regarding the processing of personal data from such technologies, CNIL notes that these must rely upon one of the legal bases for processing personal data under Article 6 of the GDPR. In particular, CNIL recalls the EDPB's position that consent is the most appropriate legal bases for processing activities carried out for advertising purposes, but that it is the responsibility of each data controller to examine which legal basis will be most appropriate on a case-by-case basis. In general, even where the data controller decides to rely upon its legitimate interests for the purposes of processing information from cookies, the specific processing purposes for which cookies will be installed must be consented to by the user (Question 27 of the FAQs).</p><p><strong>Contextual advertising</strong></p><p>Since contextual advertising is generated from information from the website itself, for example, it does not require information from the user and thus the use of trackers, unlike behaviour advertising. Conversely, trackers may need to be placed in order to measure the performance of such contextual advertising, and these latter trackers require the consent of the user (Question 28 of the FAQs).</p><div name="7.CASELAW&amp;ENFORCEMENTDECISIONS" data-unique="7.CASELAW&amp;ENFORCEMENTDECISIONS"></div><h2>7.
