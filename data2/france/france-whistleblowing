Outline the legislative protection for whistleblowing</h3><p><strong>Protection from a labour law standpoint (for employees) and administrative law standpoint (for agents)</strong></p><p>A whistleblower cannot be excluded from a recruitment procedure or access to an internship or training.</p><p>A whistleblower cannot be sanctioned, dismissed, or be the subject of a direct or indirect discriminatory measure with regards to remuneration, promotion, transfer, or reclassification.</p><p>A whistleblower benefits from a shift in the burden of proof with regard to retaliation. Indeed, if they present factual elements making it possible to presume that they acted in good faith, the person who took retaliation measures against the whistleblower will have to prove that those measures were justified by objective elements not related to the report.</p><p>In case of termination of the employment contract following a report, the whistleblower may benefit from an accelerated procedure with the Labour Court.</p><p>In addition, the Whistleblowing Law provides that whistleblowers who make reports or public disclosures may not be held liable for damages caused as a result of their reporting/disclosure, when they had reasonable grounds to believe, in doing so, that such reporting/disclosure was necessary to safeguard the interests in question.</p><p>Moreover, the Whistleblowing Law adds to the list of prohibited reprisals against whistleblowers. The full list of prohibited reprisals now includes (Article 6 of the Whistleblowing Law):</p><ul><li>suspension or lay-off;</li><li>demotion or refusal of promotion;</li><li>transfer of functions, change of workplace, reduction of salary, or modification of working hours;</li><li>suspension of training;</li><li>negative performance evaluation or work certificate;</li><li>disciplinary measures, reprimands, or other sanctions, including financial sanctions;</li><li>coercion, intimidation, harassment, or ostracism;</li><li>discrimination, disadvantageous, or unfair treatment;</li><li>non-conversion of a fixed-term or temporary contract into permanent employment, when the employee has legitimate expectations of such;</li><li>non-renewal or early termination of a fixed-term/temporary contract;</li><li>damage, including reputational damage, particularly in a public online context, or financial loss (including financial loss or loss of income);</li><li>blacklisting, on the basis of a formal or informal agreement at the branch/sector level, which may negatively impact the individual's chances of employment in that sector/industry;</li><li>early termination or cancellation of a contract for goods or services; and</li><li>cancellation of a licence/permit.</li></ul><p><strong>Protection from a criminal law standpoint </strong></p><p>The whistleblower cannot be held liable if the information they disclose violates a secret protected by law (except for violation of defence secrecy, medical secrecy, and professional secrecy of the lawyer), provided that this disclosure is necessary and proportionate to protect the interests in question and that it takes place in compliance with the reporting procedures defined by French law.</p><p>Article 5 of the Whistleblowing Law modifies Article 122-9 of the Criminal Code, adding the following paragraph, making it possible for the whistleblower to remove documents containing information of which they have had lawful knowledge without legal consequences:</p><p>'Nor shall a whistleblower be held criminally liable if he or she removes, misappropriates, or conceals documents or any other medium containing information of which he or she has lawful knowledge and which he or she reports or discloses under the conditions mentioned in the first paragraph of this Article.'</p><p>Moreover, Article 5 of the Whistleblowing Law provides that in case of trial, the whistleblower may ask the judge to allocate to them, at the expense of the other party, a provision for the costs of the proceedings or, where the whistleblower's financial situation has seriously deteriorated as a result of the whistleblower's report or public disclosure, a provision to cover the whistleblower's subsistence.</p><div name="3.2.Outlinethewhistleblowerswhoareprotectedunderthelaw.E.g.workers,agents,etc." data-unique="3.2.Outlinethewhistleblowerswhoareprotectedunderthelaw.E.g.workers,agents,etc."></div><h3>3.2.

The whistleblower will have to refer the matter to the <a href="https://www.cnctr.fr/" target="_blank">Control Commission for Intelligence</a>, which alone is competent to deal with the alert.</p><p>According to Article L634-1 of the Monetary and Financial Code (only available in French <a href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/codes/article_lc/LEGIARTI000033563064/2017-04-03/" target="_blank">here</a>), if the alert is related to banking or insurance, the whistleblower will have to refer to the <a href="https://www.amf-france.org/en" target="_blank">Financial Market Authority</a> or the <a href="https://acpr.banque-france.fr/en/page-sommaire/about-acpr" target="_blank">Control and Resolution Authority</a> in accordance with the procedures defined by these authorities.</p><div name="3.4.Islegalprotectionlimitedtocertainsubjectmatters?E.g.criminaloffences,healthandsafety." data-unique="3.4.Islegalprotectionlimitedtocertainsubjectmatters?E.g.criminaloffences,healthandsafety."></div><h3>3.4. Is legal protection limited to certain subject matters? E.g. criminal offences, health and safety.</h3><p>Pursuant to the previous regime under Sapin II, whistleblowers could report only facts of which they had personal knowledge.</p><p>However, according to the Whistleblowing Law, this condition is removed when a whistleblower reports facts that were reported to them in a professional context, even if they did not have personal knowledge of such facts. In addition, the Whistleblowing Law confirms that a whistleblower can benefit from the protection granted by the law when they reveal a fact that constitutes a 'threat or harm to the general interest' (Article 1 of the Whistleblowing Law).</p><p>Legal protection is due to whistleblowers who report:</p><ul><li>a crime or an offence; or</li><li>a serious and manifest violation of an international commitment regularly ratified or approved by France, a unilateral act of an international organisation taken based on a regularly ratified international commitment, or a law or regulation.</li></ul><p>A crime or offence can be more specifically:</p><ul><li>the existence of conduct likely to characterise acts of corruption or influence peddling;</li><li>a serious threat or prejudice to the general interest of which the issuer of the alert has personal knowledge; or</li><li>the existence or realisation of risks of serious violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms, the health and safety of persons, and the environment.</li></ul><div name="3.5.Whatinformationdoemployeeshavetobeprovidedwithaboutawhistleblowingscheme?" data-unique="3.5.Whatinformationdoemployeeshavetobeprovidedwithaboutawhistleblowingscheme?"></div><h3>3.5.

For instance, the employer is not liable in case of moral harassment made by an employee (Court of Cassation, 19 May 1988, No. 87-82.654 (only available in French <a href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/juri/id/JURITEXT000007020609/" target="_blank">here</a>)).</p><div name="8.3.Pleaseoutlineanycompensationthatisavailabletowhistleblowers.E.g.monetary/reinstatement" data-unique="8.3.Pleaseoutlineanycompensationthatisavailabletowhistleblowers.E.g.monetary/reinstatement"></div><h3>8.3.
