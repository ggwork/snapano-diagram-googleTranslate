Definitions</h2><p><strong>Email: </strong>There is no definition of email in the law. However, the Email Charter refers to an email as an 'electronic message' and defines it as any text, voice, sound, or image sent electronically.</p><p><strong>Email marketing: </strong>The sending of any message intended to promote, directly or indirectly, goods, services or the image of a person selling goods or providing services (Article L34-5 of the Communications Code).</p><p><strong>Consent: </strong>Any free, specific, and informed demonstration of willingness by which a person agrees to the use of their personal data for direct marketing purposes (Article L34-5 of the Communications Code). It must be obtained through a positive act by the individual (Article 4 (11) of the GDPR).</p><p><strong>Spam: </strong>There is no definition of 'spam' in the law. However, according to CNIL, spam are simple unsolicited commercial emails, or scam emails (the Unsolicited Messages Guidance).</p><div name="3.ConsentRequirements" data-unique="3.ConsentRequirements"></div><h2>3. Consent Requirements</h2><div name="3.1.B2C" data-unique="3.1.B2C"></div><h3><a id="column-3" name="column-3"></a>3.1. B2C</h3><p>Marketing via email in the business to consumer ('B2C') context is possible provided that the concerned persons have explicitly agreed (the opt-in) to be approached at the time of collection of their electronic address (Article L34-5 of the Communications Code and the Email Guidance).</p><p>Consent can be retracted at any time (Article 7 of the GDPR).</p><div name="3.2.B2B" data-unique="3.2.B2B"></div><h3><a id="column-4" name="column-4"></a>3.2. B2B</h3><p>Marketing emails sent to generic email addresses of legal entities (i.e. contact@nameofthecompany.com) in the business to business ('B2B') context are not subject to the principles of prior consent and to the right to object (the Email Guidance).</p><p>With regard to professional addresses of employees (i.e. nameoftheemployee@nameofthecompany.fr), it is possible to send marketing emails on the condition that the recipient was informed at the time of the collection of their details that their email address would be used for marketing purposes and was given the opportunity to opt-out in a free and simple way. Furthermore, the subject of the email must also relate to the profession of the person being solicited. For example, sending an email about software to an IT manager is acceptable without their prior consent. However, if the marketing is not related to the employee's profession, the opt-in rule applies (the Email Guidance).</p><div name="3.3.SocialMediaMarketing" data-unique="3.3.SocialMediaMarketing"></div><h3><a id="column-6" name="column-6"></a>3.3. Social Media Marketing</h3><p>The same rules apply to social media.</p><p>CNIL does not seem to differentiate between social media and email. Therefore, marketing via social media is possible provided that the concerned persons have explicitly agreed to be approached at the time of collection of their electronic address, in accordance with the opt-in rule.</p><div name="3.4.ViralMarketing" data-unique="3.4.ViralMarketing"></div><h3><a id="column-7" name="column-7"></a>3.4. Viral Marketing</h3><p>Organisations are required to obtain the consent of the recipients when sending marketing emails to addresses obtained through 'refer a friend' operations (point 20 of the Email Charter).</p><p>When the organisation plays only a simple role in the transfer of a marketing message between two individuals, it must ensure that the recipient is clearly informed of the identity of the person who makes them transmit the marketing message (point 21 of the Email Charter).</p><div name="3.5.Exceptions" data-unique="3.5.Exceptions"></div><h3><a id="column-5" name="column-5"></a>3.5. Exceptions</h3><p>The processing of personal data for direct marketing purposes may be regarded as carried out for a legitimate interest (Recital 47 of the GDPR, the Referential).</p><p>The processing of personal data for direct marketing purposes may be regarded as carried out for a legitimate interest on the condition that it&nbsp;not be overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject (Article 6(1)(f) of the GDPR).</p><p>In the B2C context, organisations are not required to obtain the prior consent of the recipient before sending electronic marketing messages if (Article L34-5 of the Communications Code, the Advertising Guidance, the Referential):</p><ul><li>there is an existing customer relationship and the message concerns products or services similar to those already provided by the organisation; and</li><li>the recipient was informed at the time of the collection of their details that their email address would be used for marketing purposes and was given the opportunity to opt-out free of charge on each occasion an email was sent.</li></ul><p>Moreover, organisations are not required to obtain the prior consent of the recipient when sending messages of a non-commercial nature (i.e. charitable, political, or religious). However, organisations must have previously informed the recipient of the use of their email address for such purposes and provide the opportunity to opt-out (the Email Guidance).</p><div name="3.6AdditionalRequirements" data-unique="3.6AdditionalRequirements"></div><h3>3.6 Additional Requirements</h3><p>Organisations are required, at the time of collecting the recipient's email address, to inform the recipient that their email address would be used for marketing purposes (the Email Guidance).</p><p>Organisations, when sending marketing by email, must clearly identify themselves and provide a free, simple, direct, and easily accessible way to opt-out from receiving any future messages (the E-commerce Guidance and the Advertising Guidance).</p><p>Organisations are required to identify the commercial nature of all marketing emails sent (point 17 of the Email Charter).</p><p>CNIL recommends collecting the right to opt-out through the use of a checkbox but advises that the use of a pre-checked box should be avoided, as this does not guarantee the expression of explicit consent and is therefore unlawful (the Email Guidance and the Advertising Guidance).</p><p>Consent cannot be presumed and cannot be weak, such as based simply on an agreement to general conditions of sale (the Email Charter). Moreover, the <a href="https://www.conseil-etat.fr/" target="_blank"><u>Conseil d'Etat</u></a> held in Case No. 368624, dated 11 March 2015 (only available in French <a href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichJuriAdmin.do?oldAction=rechJuriAdmin&amp;idTexte=CETATEXT000030445581&amp;fastReqId=1414536639&amp;fastPos=1" target="_blank"><u>here</u></a>) that mere acceptance of standard terms and conditions of use cannot be considered as a valid way to obtain consent.</p><p>The individual must be conscious that they have authorised the use of their personal data. Such an authorisation can take a number of forms, such as a tick box, a drop-down menu or a subscription to a newsletter.</p><p><strong>Right to object</strong></p><p>Where personal data is processed for direct marketing purposes, the data subject has the right to object at any time to processing of their personal data for such marketing, which includes profiling to the extent that it is related to such direct marketing (Article 21 of the GDPR).</p><p>The data subject should be able to exercise the right to object whether with regard to initial or further processing, at any time and free of charge, and such right should be explicitly brought to their attention and presented clearly and separately from any other information (Recital 70 of the GDPR).</p><p><strong>Children</strong></p><p>Specific protection should be provided with regard to personal data of children for the purposes of marketing or creating personality, or user profiles and the collection of personal data with regard to children when using services offered directly to a child (Recital 38 of the GDPR).</p><p>Companies mainly targeting a public of minors should ensure a specific notice appears on the collection forms stating that the legal representative consents to the collection of information on the minor in their care, if the latter is under 16 years old (point 26 of the Email charter).</p><div name="4.MarketingLists" data-unique="4.MarketingLists"></div><h2>4. Marketing Lists</h2><p>The sender who uses databases obtained from a third party must ensure that the data has been collected lawfully, that it is accurate and up to date, and that the individuals have consented to receiving marketing emails from other organisations (points 13 and 19 of the Email Charter). Organisations transmitting the data must collect this consent, on behalf of the recipients, at the time of the initial collection of the data. To do so, individuals must be informed of the identity of the data controller partners who would use their data for marketing purposes, through an exhaustive list made available directly on or from the collection medium (e.g., by including a hyperlink), as well as the specific purpose of the transmission (the Referential).</p><p>Otherwise, the recipients of the data must collect consent itself by soliciting the data subjects, which constitutes a processing of personal data operation which must be based on the recipient's documented legitimate interest and cannot itself be considered as a commercial proposition (the Referential).</p><p>In addition, organisations are prohibited from sending marketing emails to email addresses collected online from internet public spaces such as websites, directories, or forum discussions (the Advertising Guidance).</p><p>Organisations should maintain an up-to-date list of individuals who have opted-out from receiving any future marketing messages from the organisation (point 23 of the Email Charter).</p><p>When they intend to scrape publicly available data online, organisations must ensure that the terms of use of the website they intend to scrape data from does not forbid such a collection. Moreover, organisations must ensure to collect the data subjects' consent if the data subjects who made their data public did not reasonably expect to be the subject of marketing by another company. The mere acceptance by an Internet user, in a general and non-specific manner, of the terms of use of a service cannot be regarded as a specific consent, even if these terms of use inform the user that they may receive marketing materials by physical or electronic means (repurposing data Guidance).</p><p>The collected data must not excess the minimal requirements, especially concerning special categories of data.</p><p>Organisations are required to inform in a clear and plain way, at the latest upon the first contact with the data subjects, with all information provided in Article 14 of the GDPR, and namely on the purposes of the processing and the source of the data (the Referential).</p><div name="5.NationalOpt-OutLists" data-unique="5.NationalOpt-OutLists"></div><h2><a id="column-8" name="column-8"></a>5.

Penalties</h2><p><strong>National law</strong></p><p>Violations can result in an administrative fine being issued, the amount of which may not exceed €75,000 for a natural person and €375,000 for a legal person (Article L34-5 of the Communications Code). If a company sends marketing emails to individuals without having collected their consent at the time of the collection of their electronic address, it can be subject to the abovementioned administrative fine.</p><p>The repeated and unwanted sending of marketing emails is considered an aggressive business practice and is punishable by imprisonment for two years and a fine of €300,000 for a natural person or by a fine of €1.5 million for legal person. The amount of the fine may be increased according to the benefits derived from the offense, up to 10% of the annual average turnover. Article L121-7 of the Consumer Code provides that it is considered an aggressive business practice to 'engage in repeated and unwanted solicitations by telephone, fax, email, or any other remote communication tool'. To that extent, the repeated and unwanted sending of marketing emails could be considered as an aggressive business practice. This type of practice is subject to criminal sanctions whose maximum amounts, as mentioned above, are provided by Article L132-11 of the Consumer Code.</p><p><strong>GDPR</strong></p><p>The infringement of Article 21 of the GDPR may lead to an administrative fine of up to €20 million or, in the case of an undertaking, up to 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher (Article 83(5) of the GDPR).</p><p>The infringement of other obligations under the GDPR may lead to the imposition of additional administrative fines, in line with Article 83 of the GDPR.</p></div></div></div>
