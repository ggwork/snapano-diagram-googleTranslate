It recommends, in particular:</p><ul><li>logging to ensure traceability of accesses and actions of the various users authorised to access the information systems for a period of between six months and one year;</li><li>the implementation of an analysis system of the collected data allowing the exploitation of the collected data in the short term to answer the purpose of security aimed by the logging; and</li><li>the implementation of technical and organisational measures to limit any risk of misuse of logging data.</li></ul><p>Moreover, CNIL also published articles to assist companies when they have to face massive data breaches such as OVH fire (only available in French <a href="https://www.cnil.fr/fr/incendie-ovh-faut-il-notifier-la-cnil" target="_blank">here</a>). See also information on a health data breach of 500,000 data subjects (still under investigation) (initial press release only available in French <a href="https://www.cnil.fr/fr/fuite-massive-de-donnees-de-sante-comment-savoir-si-elle-vous-concerne-et-que-pouvez-vous-faire" target="_blank">here</a> and last update only available in French <a href="https://www.cnil.fr/fr/fuite-de-donnees-de-sante-le-tribunal-judiciaire-de-paris-demande-le-blocage-dun-site-web" target="_blank">here</a>).</p><p>CNIL has issued several sanctions on the basis of Article 34 of the pre-GDPR version of the Act which required data controllers to implement measures to protect personal data against accidental or unlawful destruction, alteration or unauthorised access. It should be noted that this Article was, however, less prescriptive for the data controller than Article 32 of the GDPR. Here is a sample of CNIL's decisions, pre-GDPR:</p><ul><li>Decision No. SAN-2017-002 of 13 April 2017 Pronouncing a Financial Penalty Against Allocab SAS (only available in French <a href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCnil.do?oldAction=rechExpCnil&amp;id=CNILTEXT000034473080&amp;fastReqId=833021271&amp;fastPos=1" target="_blank">here</a>): CNIL considered that the security of the users' personal data was not sufficient, in particular because (i) a sufficient robustness was not imposed on users' password (such passwords could be composed of a single character while CNIL requires at least eight characters with three criteria complexity) and (ii) the passwords were communicated in clear to the users for the account creation confirmation or for the recovery of password.</li><li>Decision No. SAN-2017-010 of 18 July 2017 Pronouncing a Financial Penalty Against Company X (only available in French <a href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCnil.do?id=CNILTEXT000035276047" target="_blank">here</a>): This decision revealed the extent of a data controller's security obligations towards its data processor. In this case, following a data breach on the controller's website, CNIL reproached the controller for not having enough supervision over its data processor. In particular, the data controller did not give specifications to its processor with respect to the data controller's website development. CNIL also blamed the controller for not having run tests on the website before its launch in order to guarantee the absence of any vulnerability.</li><li>Decision No. SAN-2018-001 of 8 January 2018 Pronouncing a Financial Penalty Against Etablissements Darty et Fils (only available in French <a href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCnil.do?id=CNILTEXT000036403140" target="_blank">here</a>): In this case, CNIL discovered a data breach on one of Darty's customer service tools. Darty argued that it never asked its processor for this tool, it was provided due to the processor's own initiative, and thus it never used the said tool. However, since this tool was developed for the purposes defined by Darty, Darty should still be considered as the data controller. As a data controller, Darty should have ascertained that the settings of the tool implemented did not allow unauthorised access by third parties (this pre-vulnerability screening is one of the basic tests that a company must perform in terms of security according to the CNIL). In addition, as a data controller, the company should have disabled features of the tool that are not needed/used.</li></ul><p>Since the entry into force of the GDPR, CNIL has issued several financial sanctions based on Article 32, 33 and 34 of the GDPR in the context of a data breach:</p><ul><li>Decision No. SAN-2019-005 of 28 May 2019 Pronouncing a Financial Penalty Against SERGIC, a company specialised in real estate development, purchase, sale and rental, and property management (only available in French <a href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCnil.do?id=CNILTEXT000038552658" target="_blank">here</a>): In August 2018, CNIL received a complaint from a user of the site indicating that they had been able to access, from their personal space on the site, documents registered by other users by slightly modifying the URL displayed in the browser. CNIL informed the company of the breach and initiated an investigation on the premises, during which it discovered two breaches. Firstly, CNIL discovered the failure to secure the data. CNIL considered that the company had not implemented a procedure for authenticating users of the site to ensure that the people accessing the documents were the ones who were downloading them, although this was a basic measure to be taken. Secondly, CNIL discovered the implementation of an over-extended data retention period. SERGIC retained without any time limit all data sent by unsuccessful candidates. CNIL stated that the implementation of a user authentication procedure constitutes an essential and basic measure to ensure the confidentiality of data. Aggravating factors stem from the intimate nature of the personal data made accessible, which required SERGIC to take appropriate and proportionate security measures and from the fact that SERGIC did not address the breach for six months, while it knew that a traffic peak would be likely to happen on its website shortly after discovery of the breach. As a result, CNIL imposed a penalty of €400,000 on SERGIC SAS for failing to adequately protect the data of users of its website and for implementing inappropriate procedures for storing personal data. When setting the amount of the fine, CNIL referred to Recital 86 of the GDPR which states that a data breach may, if not addressed in an appropriate and timely manner, result in physical, material or non-material damage to individuals. Even though the damage did not materialise, the delay in addressing the breach enhanced the risk.</li><li>Decision No. SAN-2019-007 of 18 July 2019 Pronouncing a Financial Penalty Against ACTIVE ASSURANCES (only available in French <a href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCnil.do?oldAction=rechExpCnil&amp;id=CNILTEXT000038810992&amp;fastReqId=2097174981&amp;fastPos=1" target="_blank">here</a>): In June 2018, CNIL received a report from one of the company's customers indicating that he had been able, from his personal account, to access personal data of other customers. An online verification carried out by CNIL revealed that the accounts of the company's customers were accessible via hypertext links referenced on a search engine. Customer documents and data could also be accessed by modifying the end of the URLs displayed in the browser. CNIL alerted the company of the security breach and the company adopted corrective measures in order to remedy such breach. However, CNIL carried out an investigation on the company's premises and found that these measures were not sufficient to prevent the referencing on the search engine. CNIL considered that this referencing could have been avoided by using, for instance, a 'robots.txt' file. CNIL also noted that the format of passwords for logging on to personal accounts was imposed by the company and corresponded to the customers' date of birth, which is not robust enough. Furthermore, after the creation of their accounts, the login ID and password were sent to customers by email in a non-encrypted form. As a result, CNIL considered that ACTIVE ASSURANCE failed to comply with its obligation to secure personal data under Article 32 of the GDPR and imposed a penalty of €180,000. When setting the amount of the fine, CNIL took into account the seriousness of the breach, due to the nature of the data and documents involved (identity documents, information relating to criminal offences, banking data, etc.), and the number of individuals concerned (several thousand customers as well as individuals who had already terminated their contracts). However, CNIL also took into account the company's responsiveness in correcting the security breach and its cooperation with the CNIL services.</li><li>Decision No. SAN-2020-008 of 18 November 2020 pronouncing a financial penalty against Carrefour France (only available in French <a href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/cnil/id/CNILTEXT000042563756" target="_blank">here</a> but a press release is available in English <a href="https://www.cnil.fr/en/cnil-fines-carrefour-france-2-25-million-eu-and-carrefour-banque-800000-eu" target="_blank">here</a>): after receiving 15 complaints from data subjects, CNIL considered that (i) the security level was inappropriate, especially given that anyone can access to an invoice with an URL link without identification needed and (ii) Carrefour France should have reported the data breach to the CNIL resulting in 4,000 successful authentications and 275 actual accesses to customer accounts. Taking into account other GDPR breaches, CNIL fined Carrefour France €2.2 million.</li><li>Decisions No. SAN-2020-015 and SAN-2020-014 of 7 December 2020 (only available in French <a href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/cnil/id/CNILTEXT000042676787" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/cnil/id/CNILTEXT000042675720" target="_blank">here</a>): Two doctors were sanctioned respectively €6,000 and €3,000 for breaches of data security obligation and failure to notify data breaches to CNIL. CNIL reminded that medical imaging device shall be subject to specific precautions that include data encryption and security of the internal computer network, secure the data contained on portable, and fixed personal computers and pay particular attention to the processing of health data. In the first decision, more than 1,200 sets of medical images and patient identifying data were exposed for approximately five years (free access and download) and in the second, more than 5,300 sets of medical images were exposed during four months (free access). Even if doctors were informed of breaches only during CNIL controls, CNIL stated that data controller must declare a violation, even when the latter is informed of this violation during a CNIL inspection.</li><li>Non-public decision of 27 January 2021 (CNIL press release only available in French <a href="https://www.cnil.fr/fr/credential-stuffing-la-cnil-sanctionne-un-responsable-de-traitement-et-son-sous-traitant" target="_blank">here</a>). Between June 2018 and January 2020, CNIL received several dozen notifications of credential stuffing personal data breaches. 40,000 customer accounts were made accessible for a year, which revealed personal data including first names, surnames, email addresses, dates of birth, loyalty card balances, and information related to orders. Both the data controller and data processor were sanctioned for a breach of the data security obligation with a financial penalty of €150,000 and €75,000 respectively. In this case, the CNIL considered that the development of a tool to fight against repeated attacks was over a year long, whereas provisional measures could have been implemented such as (i) limiting the number of authorised requests per IP address on the website and (ii) displaying a CAPTCHA as soon as users first attempt to authenticate their account, which is very difficult for a robot to bypass.</li><li>Deliberation No. SAN-2021-008 of 14 June 2021 (only available in French <a href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/cnil/id/CNILTEXT000043668709">here</a>): During the controls carried out, the CNIL revealed that the authentication when creating an account on bricoprive.com was based on a password composed only of six numeric characters of the type 123456, and that the authentication of employees to access the customer relationship management software was composed of eight characters, containing at least one number and one letter. CNIL considered that, given the low-level rules governing their composition, the robustness of the passwords accepted by the company was too low, leading to a risk of compromise of the associated accounts and the personal data they contain. Moreover, the authentication of employees to the databases was insufficiently secure due to the storage of the passwords allowing access to them, in clear text, in a text file contained in a computer of the company. In addition, the hash function used to store the passwords of employees using the bricoprive.com website was obsolete. Taking into account other GDPR breaches, CNIL fined Brico Privé €500.000.</li><li>Deliberation No. SAN-2021-008 of 28 December 2021 (only available in French <a href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/cnil/id/CNILTEXT000044609709#:~:text=32.,les%20finalit%C3%A9s%20et%20les%20moyens." class="toc-filter-processed">here</a>): As part of a research project conducted in 2015, SLIMPAY (authorised payment establishment) reused debtors' personal data for the purpose of testing an anti-fraud device. The project ended the following year, in July 2016, but the data remained hosted on a server with no special security measures. On 14 February 2020, the company was notified by one of its customers that the data could be freely accessed from the Internet using a URL that simply consisted of an IP address and a communication port, with no other access restrictions or security measures. That same evening, the company isolated the server containing the personal data concerned. The company's breach of its security obligation thus began in 2015, when the merchants' customer data was imported to a server without any security measures, and continued until February 2020, when the company was alerted by one of its customers. Following the data breach, SLIMPAY considered that the risk related to it was not high for the persons concerned and that it should therefore not inform them. Nevertheless, the CNIL considered that in view of the nature of the personal data, the volume of individuals concerned, the ease of identifying the individuals affected by the breach and the possible consequences for the individuals concerned, the risk associated with the breach can be considered as high and that the individuals concerned should have been informed. Taking into account other GDPR breaches, CNIL fined SLIMPAY €180.000.</li></ul><div name="2.NATIONALVARIATIONS" data-unique="2.NATIONALVARIATIONS"></div><h2>2.

These advertisements shall contain the information set out in Annex 2 of the Regulation, where necessary in a condensed form.

Such technological protection measures shall render the data unintelligible to any individual who is not authorised to access it (Article 4 of the Regulation and Article 120 of the Decree). In this case, the service provider must inform CNIL of the appropriate security measures put in place. This information contains in particular:</p><ul><li>the name, first name and contact details of the data controller;</li><li>a description of the protection measures;</li><li>the arrangements planned and implemented to make these measures fully effective;</li><li>where applicable, the references of the formalities completed with CNIL before the concerned processing is carried out; and</li><li>whether or not notification to affected data subjects has been carried out and, if not, the reasons justifying the absence of notification (Article 121 of the Decree).</li></ul><p>CNIL has two months to decide whether the service provider has implemented appropriate protection measures in relation to the personal data involved in the breach (Article 122 of the Decree). In the absence of a response from CNIL within this timeframe, the protective measures will be deemed inappropriate. If the provider has not notified the affected data subjects, CNIL may also, where it considers the breach serious, order the provider to inform them within a time period which shall not exceed one month (Article 122 of the Decree).</p><div name="6.PENALTIES" data-unique="6.PENALTIES"></div><h2><a id="column-21" name="column-21"></a>6.
