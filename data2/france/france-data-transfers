Governing Texts</h2><div name="1.1.Legislation" data-unique="1.1.Legislation"></div><h3>1.1. Legislation</h3><p>France is a member of the <a href="https://european-union.europa.eu/index_en" target="_blank">European Union</a> and therefore subject to the <a href="https://platform.dataguidance.com/cross-border-charts/general-data-protection-regulation" target="_blank">General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679)</a> ('GDPR'). The GDPR significantly changed the rules applicable to the processing of personal data.</p><p>Since 25 May 2018, companies, organisations, and public administrations operating in France no longer have to make declarations to the <a href="https://www.cnil.fr/professionnel" target="_blank">French data protection authority</a> ('CNIL') regarding their data processing activities, except for under very specific instances. For example, CNIL still requires declarations or authorisation requests to be made in some instances where health related-data is involved, or where processing is carried out for or on behalf of the State (you can find more information, only available in French, <a href="https://www.cnil.fr/fr/declarer-un-fichier" target="_blank">here</a>). They are competent to define their own internal data protection policies and document their compliance and must also determine the scope of their responsibilities under the accountability principle, notably to CNIL, judicial authorities, and data subjects. This includes implementing measures which they deem most appropriate to their own situation and data processing activities. Under GDPR, all data transfers in France are governed by Chapter V of the GDPR.</p><p>The GDPR leaves some room for Member States to implement and supplement the regulations through national legislation. As a result, France modified its main data protection legislation, known as the Act No.78-17 of 6 January 1978 on Data Processing, Data Files and Individual Liberties (as amended to implement the GDPR) (only available in French <a href="https://www.cnil.fr/fr/la-loi-informatique-et-libertes" target="_blank">here</a>) ('the French Data Protection Act'). The updated French Data Protection Act was then subject to further legislative changes, mainly with the aim of improving the overall structure and readability. The updated legislation can be summarised as follows.</p><p>The main update occurred via Act No. 2018-493 of 20 June 20 2018 on the Protection of Personal Data (only available in French <a href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/loda/id/JORFTEXT000037085952" target="_blank">here</a>) ('the Act on the Protection of Personal Data'), which came into force on 21 June 2018. The purpose of the update was to update French law in accordance with GDPR, and to implement the <a href="https://www.dataguidance.com/legal-research/data-protection-directive-respect-law-enforcement-directive-eu-2016680" target="_blank">Data Protection Directive with respect to Law Enforcement (Directive (EU) 2016/680)</a>, which applies to the processing of criminal data and processing activities concerning national defence or State security, together with overall improvements to the readability of the French Data Protection Act.</p><p>Subsequently, Order No. 2018-1125 of 12 December 2018 (only available in French <a href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/loda/id/JORFTEXT000037800506/" target="_blank">here</a>) was issued to further improve the readability of the national legal framework and to bring regulatory provisions in line with European law.</p><p>Finally, the Decree No. 2019-536 of 29 May 2019 onthe application of law No. 78-17 of 6 January 1978 on Data Processing, Data Files and Individual Liberties (only available in French <a href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/loda/id/JORFTEXT000038528420/" target="_blank">here</a>) was introduced in order to ensure legal certainty of the French Data Protection Act, as amended by the Act on the Protection of Personal Data, taking into account observations made by CNIL. CNIL was concerned that the then-current format of the French Data Protection Act required improvement to ensure the legal certainty of the legislative framework for data subjects and data processing organisations alike, which both require clear and readable rules that are consistent with the GDPR. The Decree also clarifies the applicable framework relating to various CNIL procedures, particularly in terms of investigations, formal notice and sanctions, completing of the process of adapting the French Data Protection Act to the GDPR, finalising the ratification of the GDPR into French law.</p><p>Since 20 June 2018, the GDPR and the French Data Protection Act have been applied in a different way to the various overseas territorial units. With the entry into force on 1 June 2019 of the new wording of the Data Protection Act, this divergence has been resolved: French overseas territories are now subject to the same legal framework as metropolitan France under Title V (Provisions relating to overseas territories, available in French <a href="https://www.cnil.fr/fr/la-loi-informatique-et-libertes#article125" target="_blank" class="toc-filter-processed">here</a>) of the French Data Protection Act.</p><p>The updated French legal framework thereby protects the rights of European citizens regarding the protection of their personal data, and holds organisations and businesses accountable for the processing and protection of their personal data.</p><p>In addition, the <a href="https://edpb.europa.eu/edpb_en" target="_blank">European Data Protection Board</a> ('EDPB') has issued <a href="https://edpb.europa.eu/our-work-tools/our-documents/publication-type/guidelines_en?field_edpb_topics_target_id%5B%5D=747&amp;field_edpb_member_states_target_id=All" target="_blank">guidelines</a> on processing of personal data which are applicable to France, including guidelines concerning data transfers:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.dataguidance.com/legal-research/guidelines-22018-derogations-article-49-under" target="_blank">Guidelines 2/2018 on derogations of Article 49 under Regulation 2016/679</a>;</li><li><a href="https://www.dataguidance.com/legal-research/guidelines-22020-articles-462a-and-463b" target="_blank">Guidelines 2/2020 on articles 46(2)(a) and 46(3)(b) of Regulation 2016/679 for transfers of personal data between EEA and non-EEA public authorities and bodies;</a></li><li><a href="https://www.dataguidance.com/legal-research/recommendations-022020-european-essential" target="_blank">Recommendations 02/2020 on the European Essential Guarantees for Surveillance Measures;</a></li><li><a href="https://www.dataguidance.com/legal-research/guidelines-052021-interplay-between" target="_blank">Guidelines 05/2021 on the Interplay between the application of Article 3 and the provisions on international transfers as per Chapter V of the GDPR;</a></li><li><a href="https://www.dataguidance.com/legal-research/information-note-data-transfers-under-gdpr" target="_blank">Information note on data transfers under the GDPR to the United Kingdom after the transition period (adopted on 15 December 2020);</a></li><li><a href="https://www.dataguidance.com/legal-research/guidelines-042021-codes-conduct-tools" target="_blank">Guidelines 04/2021 on Codes of Conduct as tools for transfers</a>; and</li><li><a href="https://www.dataguidance.com/legal-research/guidelines-072022-certification-tool" target="_blank">Guidelines 07/2022 on certification as a tool for transfers</a>.</li></ul><p>Regarding data transfers outside of the European Economic Area ('EEA'), CNIL has published recommendations concerning the transfer of personal data in the context of US legal proceedings referred to as 'Discovery' (only available in French <a href="https://www.cnil.fr/sites/default/files/atoms/files/recommandation_-_transferts_de_donnees_personnelles_dans_le_cadre_de_procedures_judiciaires_americaines_discovery.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>).</p><ul></ul><div name="1.2.Caselaw" data-unique="1.2.Caselaw"></div><h3>1.2. Case law</h3><p><strong>Schrems II and the invalidation of the Privacy Shield</strong></p><p>On 16 July 2020, the <a href="https://curia.europa.eu/jcms/jcms/j_6/en/" target="_blank">Court of Justice of the European Union</a> ('CJEU') issued a landmark judgment that invalidated the EUâ€“U.S. Privacy Shield Framework&nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.dataguidance.com/advisories/schrems-ii" target="_blank">Data Protection Commissioner v. Facebook Ireland Limited, Maximillian Schrems (C-311/18) </a></em> ('the Schrems II judgement').</p><p><strong>Google Analytics and website audience measurement tools</strong></p><p>Following the Schrems II case, CNIL received several complaints from an association known as 'NOYB', challenging the use of the website audience measurement tool Google Analytics by French companies, hosted in the US.</p><p>One of CNIL's decisions concerns <a href="https://www.dataguidance.com/legal-research/use-google-analytics-and-data-transfers" target="_blank">Google Analytics</a>&nbsp;on 10 February 2022, CNIL found that the current use of Google Analytics leads to insufficiently regulated transfers to the US. CNIL imposed on a French website manager the obligation to comply with the GDPR and, if necessary, to stop using this tool in its current condition or to use a tool that does not involve a transfer outside of the EEA.</p><p>CNIL recommends that website audience measurement and analysis tools may only be used to generate anonymous statistical data reports, providing an exemption from consent if the data controller ensures that no unlawful transfers occur. Subsequently, other formal notices were issued by CNIL against website owners using Google Analytics. The investigation by CNIL also extends to other tools used by websites that result in the transfer of personal data of Europeans from the EEA to the US.</p><p><strong>Health Data Hub / Microsoft</strong></p><p>The Health Data Hub platform is a French initiative that established a national health service data hub, to consolidate patient information in France, which was previously piecemeal across various systems. The invalidation of the Privacy Shield resulted in a preference for French or European data hosting, rather than the incumbent, US-based Microsoft.</p><p>Given the US ownership of Microsoft, French associations and trade unions referred the matter to the <a href="https://www.conseil-etat.fr/" target="_blank">French Council of State</a> ('the Council of State'), the highest administrative authority in France, in order to obtain the suspension of the Health Data Hub, which in their view was justified in order to protect the rights of data subjects and ensure that health data is processed in France, i.e., to the extent such data amounts to special category data or 'sensitive data' according to CNIL.</p><p>In an <a href="https://www.dataguidance.com/legal-research/council-state-judgement-444937-10132020" target="_blank">official decision of the French Council of State issued on 13 October 2020</a>, the Council of State considered that the Health Data Hub does not infringe on the protection of personal data and privacy, and that its removal was therefore unjustified. However, the Council of State did advise Microsoft to strengthen its data protection guarantees. On this point, the Council of State and CNIL have differing opinions. For CNIL, the choice of a hosting company subject to US law seems to be incompatible with privacy protection requirements since Microsoft retains the possibility of accessing the data processed by the Health Data Hub despite the use of data encryption, however as we can see, the Council of State did indeed permit use of a US-based vendor subject to the above safeguards.</p><p><strong>Doctolib / Amazon Web Services</strong></p><p>Doctolib is a mobile application and platform operating in France and enabling patients to find health professionals and book appointments. As part of the Covid-19 vaccination campaign, the <a href="https://solidarites-sante.gouv.fr/" target="_blank">French Ministry of Solidarity and Health</a> ('the Ministry of Health') engaged various online service providers to manage vaccination appointments, including Doctolib. For the purposes of hosting its data, Doctolib uses AWS Sarl, which is a subsidiary of the US company Amazon Web Services Inc.</p><p>In 2021, multiple French associations and professional unions made an application to the interim relief judge of the Council of State to suspend the partnership between the Ministry of Health and Doctolib, arguing that Doctolib's hosting of Covid-19 vaccination appointment data by the subsidiary of a US company entailed risks with regard to access requests by the US authorities, in the light of the Schrems II Judgment and the invalidation of the Privacy Shield.</p><p>In order to comply with the terms of the Schrems II Judgment, the interim relief judge of the Council of State verified the level of protection provided during data processing, taking into account the nature of the data in question and the provisions of the contract between Doctolib and AWS Sarl, and the law applicable to AWS Sarl. It was found the data collected in the booking of vaccination appointments did not include any information relating to specific medical conditions or vaccination eligibility, but only the identity of individuals making appointments. This data would then be deleted at the latest three months after the date of the appointment, and the data subjects also had the ability to delete it directly online.</p><p>The interim relief judge also found that the contract between Doctolib and AWS Sarl provided for a specific procedure in the event access requests were formulated by a foreign authority, providing for the challenge of any request that would not comply with the GDPR.</p><p>Finally, Doctolib had also set up a security system for the data hosted by AWS Sarl based on a trusted third party located in France in order to prevent third parties from reading the data.</p><p>Accordingly, the interim relief judge of the Council of State considered that the level of data protection was sufficient compared to the risk of a GDPR violation, and therefore rejected the application in its <a href="https://www.dataguidance.com/legal-research/decision-no-450163-12-march-2021" target="_blank">Decision No. 450163 of 12 March 2021.</a></p><p><strong>Ligue des droits de lâ€™Homme / Uber</strong></p><p>A group of Uber drivers have appealed to the Council of State through Non-Government Organisation ('NGO') <a href="https://www.ldh-france.org/" target="_blank">League of Human Rights</a> ('LDH') in order to stop the transfer of their personal data to the US, a transfer that constitutes a violation of the GDPR since the Schrems II decision mentioned above. This group of drivers is also requesting through this appeal that the data be made accessible to them when they claim their right to know how their personal data is used.</p><p>This complaint comes after the LDH lodged an appeal with CNIL, on behalf of a group of drivers, against Uber. Repeatedly condemned for insufficient data protection, the American company was accused of several serious and frequent breaches of the GDPR and the French Data Protection Act, including the failure to grant drivers access to their data and the right to object to the commercial transfer of their data. Uber was also accused of automatically suspending drivers, preventing them from carrying out their services, a practice that is contrary to Article 22 of the GDPR, as well as unreadable and incomplete files when it comes to data protection.</p><p>On 17 December 2020, CNIL decided against opening an emergency procedure, preventing the LDH from directly attacking Uber, and CNIL explained that it had forwarded the case to the <a href="https://autoriteitpersoonsgegevens.nl/nl" target="_blank">Dutch data protection authority</a> ('AP'), which it considered competent to deal with the complaint as Uber's EU headquarters are based in Amsterdam.</p><p>As a result, the LDH has appealed to the Council of State to cancel CNIL's decision, insisting that it urgently exercise its right to control and sanction in order to suspend/prohibit the transfer of Uber drivers' personal data to the US and any other third country.</p><p>In its <a href="https://www.dataguidance.com/legal-research/decision-no-449845-26-april-2022" target="_blank">decision No. 449845 of 26 April 2022</a>, the French Council of State stated that the contested decision sufficiently stated the reasons why CNIL considered that it was not competent to intervene in place of the Dutch supervisory authority. Moreover, by stating that only this authority was competent to deal with their complaint, it implicitly but necessarily rejected the request of the LDH. Then, in line with CNIL's decision, the Council of State considers that it does not follow from the Schrems II judgment that the invalidity of the <a href="https://www.dataguidance.com/legal-research/commission-implementing-decision-eu-20161250-12-july-2016-adequacy-protection" target="_blank">Commission's Implementing Decision (EU) 2016/1250 of 12 July 2016 on the Adequacy of Protection Provided by the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield</a> pronounced by this judgment would lead to the inapplication of the rules on the division of competences between supervisory authorities provided for by Article 56 of the GDPR in the event of a complaint relating to a data transfer to the US. Again in line with CNIL's decision, the Council of State indicated that it did not appear from the file documents, particularly in view of the nature of the data collected, that the transfer of the data to the US would pose a serious and imminent threat to the applicants, and that the conditions for implementing the procedure derogating from the rules on the division of powers between supervisory authorities provided for in Article 66 of the GDPR and Article 21 of the French Data Protection Act had not been met. CNIL did not commit a manifest error of assessment in considering that the conditions for implementing the derogation procedure had not been met. Thus, the French Council of State decided to reject the LDH's requests.</p><div name="2.Definitions" data-unique="2.Definitions"></div><h2>2.&nbsp;Definitions</h2><p>The French Data Protection Act is consistent with the requirements of the GDPR.</p><p><strong>Data Transfer</strong>: According to CNIL, a data transfer means every communication, copy or transfer of personal data processed outside the EEA. A transfer of personal data<strong> </strong>is an operation, or set of operations, concerning personal data and the processing activity used (collection, recording, organisation, conservation, adaptation, modification, extraction, consultation, use, communication by transmission, dissemination, or any other form of provision, reconciliation).</p><p><strong>Personal Data</strong>: The GDPR provides a basic definition of personal data which is any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (data subject). Data is classified as 'personal data' when an individual can be identified directly or indirectly through online identifiers such as a name, identification number, IP address, a location data, an online identifier through or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person (Article 4 of the GDPR). The identification of an individual can be achieved with one piece of data or through the cross-referencing of sets of data.</p><p><strong>Sensitive or Special Category data</strong>: It includes racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, information concerning health, life or sexual orientation, or criminal convictions, offences or related security measures.</p><p><strong>Data Controller</strong>: A data controller is the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means for the processing of personal data. Under certain circumstances, a data controller can be nominated under European Union or Member State law, provided specific criteria for its nomination are met (Article 4 of the GDPR).</p><p><strong>Data Processor</strong>: When personal data is processed outside personal or household purposes, it is deemed to have been processed by a data controller. Data controllers can delegate their processing tasks to data processors, but remain responsible to ensure its processing is undertaken in accordance with GDPR. A data processor<strong> </strong>is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency, or other body who processes personal data on behalf of the data controller (Article 4 of the GDPR). Examples of data processors include IT support companies or payroll providers.</p><p><strong>Data Breach</strong>: A personal data breach<strong> </strong>can take many forms including loss, accidental destruction, or disclosure of personal data without prior consent of the data subject.</p><p><strong>Data Processing: </strong>This is any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether by automated means, or manually. Examples data processing includes collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure, or destruction (see Article 4 of the GDPR).</p><p><strong>Third Party</strong>: According the GDPR, a third party is a natural or legal person, public authority, agency, or body, other than the data subject, controller, processor and persons who, under the direct authority of the controller or processor, are authorised to process personal data (see Article 4 of the GDPR).</p><div name="3.ScopeofApplication" data-unique="3.ScopeofApplication"></div><h2>3.&nbsp;Scope of&nbsp;Application</h2><p>The GDPR applies where the processing provider is:</p><ul><li>located in the EEA, even if the data relates to data subjects outside the EEA; or</li><li>located outside of the EEA, but processes data relating to EEA data subject and the provider carries out processing operations to provide goods and services to EEA residents or to target them.</li></ul><p>Typically, personal data may allow direct identification (e.g. surname, first name) or indirect identification (e.g. an identification number, address, etc.). As soon as an organisation holds one of these categories of information, the GDPR applies, even if the collection, management, and processing of data are not part of its main business activities. Therefore, as far as the scope of the legislation is concerned, the sector of business activity of the company is irrelevant. Personal data must be processed in accordance with the provisions of European law.</p><p>Article 3 of the French Data Protection Act states that all the provisions of the French Data Protection Act shall apply to the processing of personal data carried out during the course of the activities of a data controller or processor within French territory, whether the processing takes place in France or not.</p><div name="4.RestrictionsontheTransferofData" data-unique="4.RestrictionsontheTransferofData"></div><h2>4.&nbsp;Restrictions on the&nbsp;Transfer of Data</h2><div name="4.1.Withinjurisdiction/region" data-unique="4.1.Withinjurisdiction/region"></div><h3>4.1.&nbsp;Within jurisdiction/region</h3><p>Under French law, there are no specific restrictions on transfers of personal data within metropolitan France and French overseas territories.</p><div name="4.2.Outsideofjurisdiction/region" data-unique="4.2.Outsideofjurisdiction/region"></div><h3>4.2.&nbsp;Outside of jurisdiction/region</h3><p>The cross-border data transfer provisions set out in Chapter V of the GDPR apply for transfers of personal data outside of the EEA region and are applicable to France.</p><p>In principle, in France, data transfers outside the EEA region are prohibited unless a safeguard under Chapter V of the GDPR is implemented. Unless the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/index_en" target="_blank">European Commission</a> issues a determination regarding certain non-EEA countries providing an appropriate level of protection, data processors transferring personal data outside of the EEA will generally have to rely on enforceable contractual arrangements to safeguard data in accordance with Chapter V of the GDPR and any additional measures that may be required.</p><p>There are no restrictions on data being transferred to France from non-EEA countries, so long as the data exporter to ensures they comply with applicable local legislation in the source jurisdiction. Once data is received in France and processed by an entity in France, the GDPR and French Data Protection Act then apply.</p><div name="5.DataLocalisation" data-unique="5.DataLocalisation"></div><h2>5.&nbsp;Data Localisation</h2><p><strong>Data retention</strong></p><p>There are no specific data retention provisions within the French Data Protection Act. However, the principle of a limited retention period is provided for by the GDPR, whose Article 5(e) permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed. CNIL provide additional guidance in their practical guide to retention periods (only available in French <a href="https://www.cnil.fr/sites/default/files/atoms/files/guide_durees_de_conservation.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>), and website which includes the following examples:</p><ul><li>payroll and employee time management data â€“ five years;</li><li>medical data â€“ 20 years; and</li><li>log data â€“ six months.</li></ul><p>However, under French law the following matters are legislated for.</p><p><strong>Health data</strong></p><p>Hosting of health data is regulated under French law by the French Public Health Code (Article L.1111-8) (only available in French <a href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/codes/id/LEGITEXT000006072665/" target="_blank">here</a>) ('the Public Health Code'). Accordingly, Health Data Hosts ('HDS') certification is required for hosting and cloud service providers which host health data that is collected for delivering preventive, diagnostic, and other health services. Under the Public Health Code, any healthcare organisation (hospitals, pharmaceutical companies, laboratories etc.) which process French health data must use a service provider that has obtained HDS certification.</p><p>HDS certification requires that service providers implement measures to keep personal health data secure, confidential, and accessible by patients. These measures include authentication and authorisation procedures, backup systems, and encryption methods. HDS also specifies mandatory provisions which must be included in contracts with cloud service providers. These requirements apply no matter where the data is stored.</p><p><strong>Heritage and Archives</strong></p><p>CNIL, in collaboration with the <a href="https://www.francearchives.fr/" target="_blank">French Interministerial Archives Service</a> ('SIAF'), has developed the aforementioned practical guide explaining the link between the obligations of the GDPR and those imposed by the French Heritage Code (only available in French <a href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/codes/id/LEGITEXT000006074236" target="_blank">here</a>). Note that whilst the GDPR states that data should be kept for no longer than is necessary for its purpose under Article 5, it recognises that personal data may be kept for longer period for archiving and historical purposes that are in the public interest.</p><p><strong>Finance and payment data</strong></p><p>In light of the significant changes affecting payment methods (e.g. increased use of &nbsp;contactless payment or transfers between individuals), new data protection challenges have arisen. Payment data could allow to track personal activities or to identify individual behaviour and thus need a strong protection. To this end, the <a href="https://www.banque-france.fr/en/financial-stability/national-cashless-payments-committee#:~:text=The%20Committee%20gathers%20representatives%20from,Association%20of%20French%20Corporate%20Treasurers." target="_blank" class="toc-filter-processed">French National Committee for Cashless Payments</a> suggested as one of the main orientations for its 2019-2024 strategy to impose an obligation to local data related to payment transactions when this data can be linked directly or indirectly to an individual located in the EEA. The location requirement would apply to all economic actors, whether or not they are financial institutions, and would imply (i) that payment data be stored on the EEA, and (ii) that they could not be transferred outside the EEA. The obligation could take place within the frame of the GDPR, under the supervision of the data protection supervisory authorities. It was also proposed these changes be submitted by the <a href="https://www.economie.gouv.fr/" target="_blank">French Minister of the Economy</a> at the EEA level with the aim of encouraging EDPB to issue guidance on the legal status of parties in the payment chain as data controllers or processors, as well as EU financial &nbsp;institutions outsourcing the storage or processing of payment data to the cloud to require that the data is encrypted, and to use either an EEA-based cloud service provider or a non- EEA cloud service provider contractually obliged to localise the data in the EEA. Implementing these recommendations entails technical changes and new requirements for the payment industry and may also require changes resulting in a revision of the GDPR itself.</p><div name="6.Sector-SpecificRestrictions" data-unique="6.Sector-SpecificRestrictions"></div><h2>6.&nbsp;Sector-Specific Restrictions</h2><p><strong>Financial data</strong></p><p>Organisations implementing financial data processing must ensure that it complies with:</p><ul><li>the provisions of the GDPR and those of the amended French Data Protection Act; and</li><li>with all other applicable rules such as labour legislation, texts governing the public finances, taxes, transactions, etc.</li></ul><p>The procedure for transferring tax and accounting data ('TDFC') marks the commitment of the Directorate General of Public Finances ('DGFiP') to electronic data interchange ('EDI') for tax reporting.

Order of 28 March 2006 on the implementation at the Directorate-General of Public Finances and the Banque de France of an automated procedure for transferring tax data (only available in French <a href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/loda/id/JORFTEXT000000635243/" target="_blank">here</a>)&nbsp;describes the procedures established by the General Directorate of Public Finance and the <a href="https://www.banque-france.fr/en" target="_blank">Banque of France</a>.</p><p>All VAT-registered companies established in France are concerned by e-reporting, when they carry out transactions with private customers (business to consumer transactions) or with foreign operators (companies or individuals). Some foreign companies not established in France may be subject to the e-reporting obligation, as long as the transaction they carry out is with a person not subject to VAT (most often a private individual, but it may be an association or a public entity) and is taxable in France. In general, a transaction is a sequence of information exchange and related work which is processed as a single unit to fulfil a particular request. Transaction data can be financial, logistical and may include insurance costs, delivery status and employee hours etc. Major reforms proposed under Order no. 2021-1190 of 15 September 2021 (only available in French <a href="https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/jorf/id/JORFTEXT000044044176" target="_blank">here</a>) ('the Order') aims to broaden the use of electronic invoicing and the transfer of data to tax authorities, whereby companies will have to declare goods and services made and acquired.

This must comply with specific rules, in particular informing the patients included in the study, of their rights beforehand so that they can consent or object to the processing of their personal data. If the purpose of the processing of personal data is health-related research carried out by a laboratory, a service company, or an organisation participating in medical research or a study relating to the evaluation of care practices, a specific authorisation must be requested and obtained from CNIL.</p><p>In accordance with Article L. 4113-7 of the Public Health Code, the transfer of medical information concerning patients and the creation and use for commercial canvassing or promotion of files composed of data derived directly or indirectly from medical prescriptions or personal health data, are prohibited (even if they are rendered anonymous with regard to patients) if these files allow the prescribing professional to be identified.

This standard, which is aimed at all private and public employers, is in line with the simplified standard NS-46, which no longer has any legal status since the GDPR came into force. CNIL also issued guidance in July 2018 regarding personal data collected during the recruitment process (only available in French <a href="https://www.cnil.fr/sites/default/files/atoms/files/referentiel_grh_novembre_2019_0.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>).</p><p>Significant amounts of information can be collected about applicants in the process of recruitment. However, employers may only ask for information that is is necessary to verify the applicant's suitability for the job. Thus, an employer cannot ask the applicant to provide their national insurance number, information about family and friends, political opinions, or engagement in trade unions etc. Furthermore, only those involved in the recruitment process can have access to the personal information collected about applicants. Finally, if an application is not accepted but an employer wishes to keep the information collected, the applicant must be informed so that they can object, in which case CNIL advises that the retention of this data is limited to two years.</p><p>In order to carry out day-to-day staff management, an employer may collect personal information about its employees (bank details for payroll purposes, tax details for withholding tax, details of a relative who can be used as a contact in the event of an emergency affecting the employee, etc.). CNIL emphasises that 'the employer should only collect the data that it really needs, and should only do so from the moment that this need becomes a reality'. It is the employer's responsibility to control access to this data, so that only authorised persons can access it. The information can be kept for the duration of an employee's employment, however, certain elements must be preserved even after the employee has left, in order to meet the employer's accounting, social and tax obligations (e.g. documents relating to each employee's pay or contract must be kept for five years after post-employment).</p><p>An employer is permitted to view files, e-mails and search history of employees in the course of their duties. These checks must respect the privacy of each employee, who must be informed of the purpose of the checks. An e-mail with the subject 'personal' or 'private' cannot be consulted by the employer. Furthermore, according to CNIL, the use of software allowing 'remote recording of all actions performed on a computer', also known as keylogging, is illegal, except when it meets an exceptional security requirement.</p><p><strong>Rental properties</strong></p><p>Organisations renting accommodation on their own behalf or as a representative of the landlord which involves data processing and transfers must ensure that they comply with:</p><ul><li>the provisions of the GDPR and those of the amended French Data Protection Act; and</li><li>all other applicable rules and regulations.</li></ul><p>In order to assist letting agencies and landlords, CNIL adopted a guidance framework on 6 May 2021 (only available in French <a href="https://www.cnil.fr/sites/default/files/atoms/files/referentiel_relatif_aux_traitements_de_donnees_personnelles_mis_en_oeuvre_dans_le_cadre_de_la_gestion_locative.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>) ('the Guidance').</p><p>Organisations renting out accommodation as well as intermediaries involved in renting out accommodation process significant amounts of personal data relating to landlord, tenants and guarantors. Such guidance framework, adopted by CNIL following a public consultation, enables these organisations to control the processing of data relating to rental management while respecting the principles of data protection and the rights of individuals.</p><p>The guidance framework sets out:</p><ul><li>the data likely to be collected;</li><li>the recipients and to whom such data may be provided or transferred; and</li><li>the applicable data retention periods.</li></ul><div name="7.DataTransferSolutions" data-unique="7.DataTransferSolutions"></div><h2>7.&nbsp;Data Transfer Solutions</h2><div name="7.1.Legislativeexceptionstotherestrictions" data-unique="7.1.Legislativeexceptionstotherestrictions"></div><h3>7.1.

In addition, both the European Commission published factsheets on the new framework, respectively&nbsp;here&nbsp;and&nbsp;here, which explains that the agreement in principle must now be translated into legal documents whereby the US commitments will be incorporated into an Executive Order that will form the basis of a draft adequacy decision by the European Commission.</p><p>The&nbsp;White House&nbsp;announced, on 7 October 2022, that President, Joseph Biden, had signed, on the same date, an&nbsp;Executive Order on Enhancing Safeguards for United States Signals Intelligence Activities&nbsp;('the Executive Order'), which directs the steps that the US will take to implement its commitments under the European Union - U.S. Data Privacy Framework ('EU-US DPF').

An entity can be sanctioned for a violation of the GDPR following a complaint or an inspection undertaken by CNIL. A retrospective inspection constitutes a privileged way of intervening with personal data processors, allowing CNIL to monitor legal compliance and implementation of GDPR and related legislation. In 2021, CNIL carried out 384 investigations (including online, on-site, record-based and hearing-based inspections). Individuals are free to lodge/file a complaint or report to CNIL in the following cases: when the person is unable to exercise their rights under the Act of 6 January 1978, or when they want to report a breach of the personal data rules by a public or private entity.</p><p>Introduced into French law by amended French Data Protection Act, a warning is a 'corrective measure' provided by the GDPR which allows the President of CNIL to warn an organisation where its planned processing of personal data is likely to be in breach of GDPR and/or applicable French law. If the warning is ignored and an organisation proceeds, the President of CNIL can issue a formal notice to comply within a specified period. These formal notices may be made public depending on the seriousness of the breaches observed or the number of persons affected. In 2021, CNIL issued 135 formal notices, two of which were published.</p><p>Following inspections or complaints, if controllers and processors fail to comply with the terms of the GDPR or the law, CNIL's restricted panel (five members and a chairman distinct from the chairman of CNIL) may impose sanctions on them. The GDPR provides for financial penalties of up to â‚¬10 million or, for companies, 2% of annual worldwide turnover (e.g. failure to comply with the rules on privacy by design), or â‚¬20 million or, for companies, 4% of annual worldwide turnover (e.g. failure to respect the rights of data subjects, failure to comply with an injunction from CNIL etc.). These sanctions may be publicly disclosed and must be effective, proportionate, and dissuasive. CNIL must consider certain criteria to determine the amount of the fine, including the actions taken by the controller or processor to limit the damage, the degree of cooperation with CNIL, whether the controller or processor notified CNIL of the infringement, etc. CNIL's powers of investigation, injunction and consultation are strengthened.</p><p>When breaches of the GDPR or the law are brought to its attention, CNIL's restricted committee may:</p><ul><li>issue a reminder;</li><li>order the processing to be brought into compliance, including under a penalty payment;</li><li>temporarily or definitively restrict processing;</li><li>suspend data flows;</li><li>order that requests for the exercise of individuals' rights be met, including under a penalty payment; and</li><li>issue an administrative fine.</li></ul><p>From the date of notification of the decision of the restricted panel, the accused body has two months to appeal to the Council of State against CNIL's decision.</p></div></div></div>
